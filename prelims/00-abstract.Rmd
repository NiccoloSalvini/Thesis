This thesis has the aim to extract, infer and predict monthly rental price on Milan Real Estate market exploiting _Bayesian geostatistics_ through a convenient computing alternative called INLA.
Data originates from immobiliare.it database and it is extracted through a _scraper_ built on top of the website. The scraper is _optimized_ with respect to both the _server side_ kindly requesting permission and imposing delayed-request rates, and the _client side_ by granting continuity through fail handlers and request's headers rotation. Scraping functions exploits a custom workflow that combines url reverse engineering and optimal searching strategies for scraping. This dramatically speeds up scraping since a dedicated function can recompose urls starting from functional parameter arguments and call scraping on those urls. Speed comes from the fact that differently from spiders and derivatives which operate a full crawling down of the web site, the workflow concentrates only on a restricted set of urls. A further critical speed boost is offered by parallelism and a run time benchmark demonstrates the scraper rapidity for two recent parallel back ends along with their respective parallel looping options.
The scraper is then wrapped into a API through an opinionated R framework, namely _Plumber_. The API is forced into a _Docker_ container with a custom Dockerfile. The container is then served into a free tier _EC2_ machine, secured and load balanced with _NGINX_. The architecture principles stacked on top of the http API elevates to rest RESTful. Software automatic deployment and integration is managed through a easy cloud workflow that exploits git, DockerHub which allows images to be pulled into the EC2. Once the API endpoint is invoked, data is simultaneously scraped and collected into a JSON format.
Spatial bayesian traditional methods are generally slow since matrix inversion computations scales to a cubic order. Therefore Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA) is applied constituting a faster computational alternative on a special type of models called Latent Gaussian models (LGM). _INLA_ combines analytics approximations and numerical integration to obtain an approximated posterior distribution of the parameters in a shorter time frame.
The theoretical foundations of the statistical model are found in the economic literature by Hedonic Price Models (HPM). HPM relates the value of the property to its demand-offer price equilibra for each of its singular house characteristic. Nevertheless HPM are generally used to estimate house prices, but recent and non recent literature suggests that its application on rental prices is correct because they are considered as a proxy value.
A Bayesian hierarchical model is applied to the data so that the spatial component is distinct from the latent linear predictor. The spatial component is considered as a discrete realization of an underlying unobserved continuous Gaussian Process (GP) which it is aimed to estimate. Are only considered special types of GP process that shares two properties: Stationarity and Isotropy and are treated with a special covariance function i.e. Matérn.
Given a stationary and isotropic GP whose covariance matrix is Matérn, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations solutions (SPDE) can provide a GMRF representation of the GP that enables a computational short cut. The latent linear predictor hyper-parameters are fitted and cross validated with the GP parameters and inference on posterior distribution is given. Prediction on a continuous surface gives the intuition on monthly price distribution over the study domain area and result are summarized on a Shiny App.

First of all I acknowledge a special debt to **Professor Della Vedova** who has patently followed me during this 6 months long journey, he has encouraged me and let me try things never done before. Our communication through this process has always been transparent and each moment spent was a lesson to learn. I came to his office desk with strong ideas and he let me shape my dissertation giving me carte blanche. Most of all when something was not working he has always been keen to solve and suggest a better approach. I owe a lot also to Dr. **Vincenzo Nardelli**, he is one of the kindest and most talented guys I have ever met. I took a big inspiration by its works. He has been a true street opener to me, he introduced me to web scraping, then to our newly born social platform Data Network and then to the Spatial Statistics. Sometimes I feel like I am copying him, but then I realize that it is just inspiration. I owe also a huge thanks to **Professor Lucia Paci**. She has been one of the top teacher in my master course to me by far. She has the capability to explain very hard stuff and to transpose it in the easiest way possible. She narrowed my path through bayesian methods for spatial statistics, since she was co-author of one of the main book references that I got. The bayesian statistical intuition relies on her thoughts and on her experience on the subject. 
I will not for sure miss to thank my beautiful girlfriend **Elisabetta**, She has seen my darkest times and my deepest insecurities, she did not even blink and she kept helping me like day one. Without her really anything would not have been even possible. She is so smart and she know me so well that when I had downs, even though she had had her own issues, she carried the weights and broght the only medicine I know: "Sciacchiata o Gelato". I would love to thank my father **Muzio** to be such a big milestone both in my career and private life, he has always encouraged me pursuing my dream by never setting any sort of limit. Its life could be compressed into a Frank Sinatra song "My Way" and observing him, working speakly, I wish the future would bless me with its same independence and freedom. Special thanks are dedicated also to my beloved uncles, zia **Jolanda** and zio **Luciano**.  They put a stake on me, they always make me feel special and talented even though university has never given me the chance to truly express myself. Me and Zio Luciano conversations are inspirational, he knows all the ropes, he is the most talented business man I am ever going to see in my entire life, I wish I could have a tenth of its talent. What I do is mainly because of its enormous successes and sacrifices. Memory is just for people that have to rely on past to act in the present. You take care of today so that tomorrow you can shape the future. Zia Jolanda you gave me back the most important thing, family, you have never missed special and difficult moments. You supported me and my mother throughout our exhausting journey I would never find the words to express much gratitude for what you did. You are an angel. 
To all my friend thanks for each of your unspecified, different but vital support. Unfortunately this is becoming too long, a party is going to be thrown and with sincere tears and a piece of a paper I will do justice.

## Dedication {-}

To my beloved mother, Maria Cristina. She has done so much for me you would not even know. We have been facing fires and flames for God knows how long, and now look where we are. You can not imagine how strong she is and if you do, please try to explain me then. I have always thought that mothers have this type of superpowers, but believe me my mother exaggerates.
Our relationship has never been easy, we have both of us strong attitudes, nevertheless we keep on persisting and the reason is that we can not be set apart. Never.
The most I have done since I remember is for her and for her satisfaction. I do not and I would never regret it. She is my inspiration, and I hope someday that I will live up to you mamma. she went "all in" sending me in Milan.
She did right.
Mum's always right.
