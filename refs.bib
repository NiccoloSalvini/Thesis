  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;The cluster of pneumonia cases linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), first reported in China in late December 2019 raised global concern, particularly as the cumulative number of cases reported between 10 January and 5 March 2020 reached 80,711. In order to better understand the spread of this new virus, we characterized the spatial patterns of Covid-19 cumulative cases using ArcGIS v.10.4.1 based on spatial autocorrelation and cluster analysis using Global Moran’s I (Moran, 1950), Local Moran’s I and Getis-Ord General G (Ord and Getis, 2001). Up to 5 March 2020, Hubei Province, the origin of the Covid-19 epidemic, had reported 67,592 Covid-19 cases, while the confirmed cases in the surrounding provinces Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan were 1351, 1272, 1215 and 1018, respectively. The top five regions with respect to incidence were the following provinces: Hubei (11.423/10,000), Zhejiang (0.212/10,000), Jiangxi (0.201/10,000), Beijing (0.196/10,000) and Chongqing (0.186/10,000). Global Moran’s I analysis results showed that the incidence of Covid-19 is not negatively correlated in space (p=0.407413&amp;gt;0.05) and the High-Low cluster analysis demonstrated that there were no high-value incidence clusters (p=0.076098&amp;gt;0.05), while Local Moran’s I analysis indicated that Hubei is the only province with High-Low aggregation (p&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

 ISSN = {00420980, 1360063X},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/43196351},
 abstract = {In this paper, an analysis is made of what would be the rent difference for the tenants of subsidised units if these units were rented as unsubsidised units. Furthermore, the existence of any pecuniary disadvantage for the owner of a subsidised unit is investigated by considering his rental revenue (i.e. the amount paid by the tenant and the subsidy). It is found that there exists a premium between an unsubsidised and a subsidised unit when using the amount paid by the tenant (i.e. the rent) as the dependent variable. Also, the subsidy system in Geneva has an influence on the pricing of each characteristic of a unit. Furthermore, it is found that when using rental revenue as the dependent variable, both sub-samples can be used in a single hedonic equation. Thus, owners of subsidised units are not at a disadvantage due to the granting of a subsidy. As a result, Geneva's subsidy system matches the goals of agents on both the demand and supply sides.},

  abstract = "Customarily, for housing markets, interest focuses on selling prices of properties at locations and times. Hedonic models are employed using property-level, neighborhood-level, and economic regressors. However, in hedonic modeling the fact that the locations and times of property transactions are random is ignored. Here, we focus on explanation of the locations of transactions in space and time, viewing them as a point pattern over space and time. Our contribution is to explain such a point pattern using suitable regressors. We examine two explanatory models, the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox process. We study a point pattern in the city of Zaragoza, Spain, over the years, 2006–2014. We argue for point level modeling since the process of property sales operates at that scale. We elaborate efficient computation for fitting the foregoing models to the Zaragoza data. We show how the modeling enables rich inference and extraction of novel stories for this market over this time period. In addition, we clarify the potential benefits of this modeling for brokers, buyers, and administrators. To our knowledge, this is the first application of formal space–time point pattern analysis to locations of urban real estate transactions."

  abstract = { This paper investigates some problems associated with an argument evaluation order that we call “future” order, which is different from both call-by-name and call-by-value, In call-by-future, each formal parameter of a function is bound to a separate process (called a “future”) dedicated to the evaluation of the corresponding argument. This mechanism allows the fully parallel evaluation of arguments to a function, and has been shown to augment the expressive power of a language. We discuss an approach to a problem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to be relevant when they were created become irrelevant through being ignored in the body of the expression where they were bound. The problem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessing problem-solving systems which start several processors working on the same problem but with different methods, and return with the solution which finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawback that the processes which are investigating the losing methods must be identified, stopped, and re-assigned to more useful tasks. },
