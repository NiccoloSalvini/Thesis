Data comes packed into the REST API end point `*/complete` in .json format. Data can be filtered out On the basis of the options set in the API endpoint argument body. Some of the options might regard the `city` in which it is aevaluated the real estate market, `npages` as the number of pages to be scraped, `type` as the choice between rental of selling. For further documentation on how to structure the API endpoint query refer to section \@ref(APIdocs).  Since to the analysis purposes data should come from the same source (e.g. Milan rental real estate within "circonvallazione") a dedicated endpoint boolean option `.thesis` is passed in the argument body. What the API option under the hood is doing is specifying a structured and already filtered URL to be passed to the scraping endppoint. By securing the same URL to the scraping functions data is forced to come from the same URL source. The idea behind this concept can be thought as refreshing everyday the same immobiliare.it URL. API endpoint by default also specifies 10 pages to be scraped, in this case 120 is provided leading to to 3000 data points. The `*` refers to the EC2 public DNS that is `ec2-18-224-40-67.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

`http://*/complete/120/milano/affitto/.thesis=true`

As a further source data can also be accessed through the mondgoDB credentials with the cloud ATLAS database by picking up the latest .csv file generated. For run time reasons also related to the bookdown files continuous building the API endpoint is called the day before the presentation so that the latest .csv file is available. As a consequence code chunks outputs are all cached due to heavy computation.
Interactive  maps are done with Leaflet, the result of which is a leaflet map object which can be piped to other leaflet functions. This permits multiple map layers and many control options to be added interactively (LaTex output is statically generated)

A preliminary API data exploratory analysis evidences 34 covariates and 250 rows, which are once again conditioned to the query sent to the API. Immobiliare.it furnishes many information regarding property attributes and estate agency circumstances. Data displays many NA in some of the columns but georeference coordinates, due to the design of scraping functions, are in any case present.

Data needs to undergo to many previous cleaning preprocess steps, this is a forced stage since API comes in human readable format, which is from one hanb designed to a be readble format, but from the other it is not prepared to be modeled. cleaning steps mainly regards:

- encoding from UTF-8 to Latin due to Italian characters incorrectly parsed.
- *FLOORS* covariate needs to be separated by its *ASCENSORE* and *ACCDISABILI* components, leading to have 2 further bivariate covariates.
- *LOCALI* needs to undergo to be separated in its components too. 5 categories levels drain out: *TOTLOCALI*, *CAMERELETTO*, *ALTRO*, *BAGNO*, *CUCINA*. *TOTLOCALI* is a duplicate for *NROOM* the is discarded.
- *APTCHAR* is a list column so that each observation has different categories insiside. The preprocess step includes unnesting the list by creating as many bivariate columns as elements in the list. Then new columns flag the existemce of the caracteristics in the apartement. A slice for the fist observation displays:

`r datiprep %>%  select(APTCHAR) %>%  slice(sample(1))  %>% pull`

### Maps and Geo-Visualisations

Geographic coordinates can be represented on a map in order to reveal first symptoms of spatial autocorrelation. Observations are spread almost equally throughout the surface even though the response var *PRICE* indicates unsurprisingly that higher prices are nearer to the city center.
The map in figure \@ref(fig:leaflet_visuals) is a leaflet object, which can needs to be overlapped with layers indicating different maps projections. This is interactive in the .html version, and static is proposed in the .pdf output version. The map object takes a input the latitute and longitude coordinates coming from THE API, and they do not need any CRS (Coordinate Reference System) projection since leaflet can accept the data type.

```{r leaflet_visuals, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Leaflet Map}

if(knitr::is_latex_output()){
    knitr::include_graphics("images/leaflet_prezzi.jpg")
} else if(knitr::is_html_output()){  
  dati2 = dati %>%
    dplyr::select(LAT, LONG, PRICE )
  pal = colorBin("viridis", bins = c(1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 5000))
  
  leaflet(dati2) %>%
    # addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% bug in Lealfet while caching
    setView(lat = 45.474211, lng = 9.191383, zoom = 13) %>%
    addMiniMap() %>% 
    addTiles() %>% 
    addCircles(lng = ~LONG, 
               lat = ~LAT, 
               color = ~ pal(PRICE),
               weight = 10,
               radius = ~log(PRICE)) %>%
    addLegend("bottomright",
      pal = pal, values = ~PRICE,
      title = "Prices") %>%
    addScaleBar(position = c("bottomleft"))
  }
```

## Counts and First Orientations

Arranged Counts for categorical columns can give a sense of the distribution of categories across the dataset suggesting also which predictor to include in the model. The visualization in figure \@ref(fig:counts) offers a a reordered *TOTLOCALI* 5 levels categories. Bilocali are the most common option for rent, then trilocali comes at second place. The strighforward intution behind suggests that Milan rental market is oriented to "lighter" accomodation solutions in terms of space and squarefootage. This should comes natural since Milan is both a vivid study and working area, so short stayings are relevant.(anche se ti aspetti che ci siano famiglie quindi case un po' più grandi) The prevalence of bilocale is also the result of coherent investement choices by investor across italy. Expeditures and risks associated to having a bilocale are much less than the ones with larger squarefootage.

```{r fct_counts, fig.cap="Most common housedolds categories for Milan Real Estate Market"} 
datiprep %>%
  mutate(TOTLOCALI = as_factor(TOTLOCALI)) %>% 
  count(TOTLOCALI, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(TOTLOCALI = fct_reorder(TOTLOCALI, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, TOTLOCALI)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "# of houses",
       y = "",
       title = "Most common housedolds categories in Milan")+
  theme_nicco()
```

  mutate(TOTLOCALI = glue("{ TOTLOCALI } ({ TOTLOCALI_count })"),
         TOTLOCALI  = fct_reorder(TOTLOCALI, PRICE)) %>%

       y = "",

```


this visualization permits to display bi modals adn multimodsals distribution, Log scales was needed since they are all veru skewd and log scale then is needed also in the model.

## Missing Assessement and Imputation

As already pointed out some data went missing since immobiliare provides data that in turn is filled by estate agencies or privates through pre compiled standard formats. Some of the missing observations can be reverse engineered by other information in the web pages e.g. given the street address it is possible to trace back the lat and long coordinates, even though this is already handled by the API through scraping functions with the mechanism found in section \@ref(ContentArchitecture). Some of the information lacking in the summary table they might be desumed and then imputed by the estate agency review which is one of the covariates and where the most of the times missing information can be found. The approach followed in this part is to prune redundant information and "over" missing covariates trying to limit the dimensionality of the dataset.

### Missing assessement 

The first problem to assess is why information are missing. As already pointed out in the introduction part and in section \@ref(ContentArchitecture) many of the presumably important covariates (i.e. price lat, long, title ,id ...) undergo to a sequence of forced step inside scraping functions with the aim to avoid to be missed.  If in the end of the sequence the covariates values are still missing, the correspondent observation is not imputed and it is left out of the scraped dataset. The author choice to follow this approach relies on empirical observation that suggest when important information is missing then the rest of the covariates also do, as a consequence the observation is not useful. Moreover when the spatial component can no be reverse engineered then it is also the case of left out observation while scraping. The model needs to have a spatial component in order to be evaluted. To this purpose The missing profile is crucial since it can also suggest problems in the scraping procedure. By identifying pattern in missing observation the maintainer can take advantage of it and then debug the part that causes missingness. In order to identify the pattern a revision of missigness is introduced by @Little .randomnes can be devided into 3 categories:

- *MCAR* (missing completely at random) likelihood of missing is equal for all the infromation, in other words missing data are one idependetn for the other.
- *MAR* (missing at random) likelihood of missin is not equal.
- *NMAR* (not missing at random) data that is missing due to a specific cause, scarping can be the cause.

MNAR is often the case of daily monitoring clinical studies [@Kuhn2019], where patient might drop out the experiment because of death and so as a consequence all the data starting from the death time +1 is missing.
To assess pattern A _heat map_ plot fits the need: 

```{r Heatmap, fig.cap="Missingness Heatmap plot"}
data1 = datiprep %>% select(-which(colMeans(is.na(.)) < 0.001)) ## % of missing
convert_missing = function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), 0, 1)
scat_missing = apply(data1, 2, convert_missing)

Heatmap(
  scat_missing, 
  name = "Missing", #title of legend
  column_title = "Predictors", row_title = "Samples",
  col = c("black","lightgrey"),
  show_heatmap_legend = FALSE,
  row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 0) # Text size for row names
)
```

Looking at the top of the heat map plot \@ref(fig:Heatmap) under the "Predictor" label the first tree split divides data into two sub-groups. The left branch considers from *TOTPIANI* to *CATASTINFO* and there are no substantial relevant worrying patterns.  Then missingness can be traced back to the MAR case. Imputation needs to be applied up to *CONDOM* included, the others are discarded due to rarity: i.e. *BUILDAGE*: 14% missing, *CATASTINFO*: 21% and *AC*: 24%. Moreover *CUCINA*,*ALTRO* are generated as separation of the originale LOCALI variable, so it should not surprise that their missing behavior is similar. Nevertheless their missing % is respectively 13% and 14%, as a consequence  they are discarded. 
(capire se fare imputation per bagno cameraletto altro e cucina)
In the far right hand side *ENCLASS* and *DISP* data are completely missing, this can be addressed to a scraping fail to capture data. Further inspection of the API scraping process focused on the two covariates is strongly advised. From *LOWRDPRICE.* covariates class it seems to be witnessing a missing underlining pattern NMAR which is clearer by looking at the co_occurrence plot \@ref(fig:cooccurrence). Co-occurrence analysis might suggest frequency of missing predictor combinations and *LOWRDPRICE.* class covariates are displyaing this tyoe of behaviour. *PAUTO* is missing where lowered price class covariates are missing but this is not true for the contrary leading to the conclusion that *PAUTO* should be treated as a rare covariate, therefore *PAUTO* is discarded.
After a further investigation *LOWRDPRICE.* flags when the *PRICE* covariate is effectively decreased and this is not so common, that is solved by grouping the covariate's information and to encode it as a two levels categorical covariate. Further methods to feature engineer the lowrdprice. class covariates can be treated with profile data, but this is beyond the scope, further references are @Kuhn2019.

```{r cooccurrence, fig.cap="Missingness co-occurrence plot"}
gg_miss_upset(data1, nsets = 7) 
```
```{r resulting_data}
drop = datiprep %>% dplyr::select(-ID:LOCATION, ) %>%  names

datiprep = datiprep %>%  
  dplyr::select(-all_of(drop))

```


### Covariates Imputation

A simple approach to front missing observations is to build a regression model to explain the covariates with the missing observations and plug-in the obtained estimates (e.g. posterior means) from their predictive distributions (Little and Rubin 2002). This approach is fast and easy to implement in most cases, but it ignores the uncertainty about the imputed values. However it has the benefit to be a reasonable choice with respect to the numbr of computation required. That makes it the first choice method to follow.
A further method for imputation has been designed by _Gómez-Rubio, Cameletti, and Blangiardo 2019) miss lit_ by adding a sub-model for the imputations to the final model through the inla functio. This is directly handled inside the predictor formula adding a parameter in the latent field. However the approach makes the model more complex with a further layer of uncertainty to handle. 
At first the additive regression model with all the covariates is called including the covariates with missing values. The response variable *PRICE* displys no missing values.

```{r imputation}
data_miss = datiprep %>%  
  rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  select(-id,-lat,-long,-location, -buildage, -totlocali, -cucina, -altro, -ac,-pub_date, -catastinfo, -aptchar, -age,-lowrdprice.originalprice,-lowrdprice.currentprice, -lowrdprice.passeddays,-lowrdprice.date,-enclass,-contr ,-disp, -pauto,-review,  -hasmulti,-title) %>% 
  as.data.frame() 

cov_imputation = inla(price ~ 1 + condom +floor+ascensore+accdisabili+indivsapt+camereletto+bagno+status+heating+photosnum+totpiani+sqfeet+nroom, data = data_miss, verbose = TRUE )
```


When the model is called INLA fit the model on the existing observations ignoring the missing ones. A summary of the model is now proposed. Once the model is trained then the posterior means can be imputed in the place where the respective covariates are missing. Then the model is called a second time to check changes in parameter estimates. The approach followed kindly differ from @Rubio2019 section 12.4 since response var in this case has not missing values, this should anyway give a better estimates since the model is trained on the whole set of the response variable observation. On the other hand, more than one covariates, the ones sentenced to be MAR, have missing values, therefore inla ultimately trains the model on the covariates' missing union set. e.g. missing observations CONDOM `r dati %>%  drop_na(CONDOM) %>%  dim() %>% .[1]`, missing in combination with other covariates.
`r dati %>%  drop_na() %>%  dim() %>% .[1]`




## Spatial Autocorrelation assessement 




Spatial data come packed into point reference 

- tmap 
- leaflet 
- gganimate 

```{r semivariogram}
semivar = variogram(PRICE~1, 
                       locations= ~LONG+LAT,
                       data=dati)
```

## Model Specification



## Mesh building 

*PARAFRASARE*
The SPDE approach approximates the continuous Gaussian field $w_{i}$ as a discrete Gaussian Markov random field by means of a finite basis function defined on a triangulated mesh of the region of study. The spatial surface can be interpolated performing this approximation with the inla.mesh.2d() function of the R-INLA package. This function creates a Constrained Refined Delaunay Triangulation (CRDT) over the study region, that will be simply referred to as the mesh. Mesh should be intended as a trade off between the accuracy of the GMRF surface representation and the computational cost, in other words the more are the vertices, the finer is the GF approximation, leading to a computational funnel. 

![Traingularization intuition, @Krainski-Rubio source](images/triangle.jpg)

Arguments can tune triangularization through inla.mesh.2d() :

* `loc`:location coordinates that are used as initial mesh vertices
* `boundary`:object describing the boundary of the domain,
* `offset`:  argument is a numeric value (or a length two vector) and it is used
to set the automatic extension distance. If positive, it is the extension distance
in the same scale units. If negative, it is interpreted as a factor relative to the
approximate data diameter; i.e., a value of -0.10 (the default) will add a 10%
of the data diameter as outer extension.
* `cutoff`: points at a closer distance than the supplied value are replaced by a single vertex. Hence, it avoids small triangles 
* `max.edge`: A good mesh needs to have triangles as regular as possible in size and shape.
* `min.angle`argument (which can be scalar or length two vector) can be used to specify the minimum internal angles of the triangles in the inner domain and the outer extension

A convex hull is a polygon of triangles out of the domain area, in other words the extension made to avoid the boundary effect. All meshes in Figure 2.12 have been made to have a convex hull boundary. If borders are available are generally preferred, so non convex hull meshes are avoided.

```{r non_convex_hull, eval=FALSE}
bound = inla.nonconvex.hull(coords)
```

### Shinyapp for mesh assessment

INLA includes a Shiny (Chang et al., 2018) application that can be used to tune the mesh params interactively

```{r meshbuilder, eval = FALSE}
INLA::meshbuilder()
```


The mesh builder has a number of options to define the mesh on the left side. These include options to be passed to functions inla.nonconvex.hull() and inla.mesh.2d() and the resulting mesh displayed on the right part.
