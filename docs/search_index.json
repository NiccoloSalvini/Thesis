It can be done automatically and simultaneously. Given the substantial unavailability of fresh data regarding Milan Real Estante rental markets, this practices have to be forcibly applied. Data in website appears to be well organized and easily accesible, nevertheless sometimes they are not Lo web scraping è una tecnica di estrazione dei dati da pagine internet statiche o dinamiche in maniera automatica e simulatanea (Wikipedia 2020). L’impossibilità di reperire dati aperti aggiornati riguardo l’affitto sul mercato italiano mi ha spinto a sviluppare sofisticate tecniche di estrazione di dati orientate ad alleggerire lo sforzo e aumentare la velocità di reperimento: da una parte nel preprocessing del dataset, nella successiva del fragente del modelling, per finire con la reattività di risposta dell’applicazione. Le informazioni sui siti appaiono spesso ordinate e semplici, tuttavia ogni sito web ha una propria architettura e un proprio linguaggio. Per architettura intendo struttura gerarchica secondo cui è organizatto un sito internet: una semplificazione della struttura di un sito web può essere un insieme di cartelle innestate una dentro l’altra collegate tra loro da riferimenti tramite l’url. la natura gerarchica della struttura prevede che si usi un linguaggio che fa propria questa caratteristica, HTML è il preferito. L’html si organizza in nodi ed angoli, esattamente come un grafo; che aggiunta la componente gerarchica fa sì che questo sia un albero. Difatti spesso ci si riferisce alla struttura delle pagine web come html tree. Ogni elemento nella pagina ha un suo preciso posto nel codice sorgente della stessa e ha un preciso valore o più valori. Possiamo immaginare ogni nodo della pagina come una lista di valori che è collegata ad un nodo precedente detto padre da una struttura gerarchica superiore, ed eventiualmente ad un nodo successivo detto figlio. Pertanto tutte le informazioni che giacciono sotto al nodo padre sono parenti del nodo padre e sono direttamente collegate (directed nel senso dell’interpretazione), parallelamente ci saranno altri nodi padre che saranno adiacenti al nodo padre, i quali avranno nodi figli e così via. La complessità della pagina e del codice è tanto maggiore quanto il livello dell’albero aumenta, tanto più l’albero è folto tanto più sarà difficile individurare il ramo o la foglia che ci interessa. Ragionevolemnte accade lo stesso per la funzione di scraping e il tempo di scraping. Html organizza i contenuti e le relazioni tra loro, il css (Cascading Style Sheets) invece si occupa dello stile e della formattazione degli stessi. il css è uno strumento molto potente in mano ad uno scraper perchè permette di recuperare informazioni simili tra loro ma che occupano nodi con posizione gerarchica diversa all’interno della pagina. Pertanto una volta letto l’html della pagina sarà necessario recuperare la query css per raccogliere tutti gli elementi di interesse tramite la funzione di scraping. Successivamente occorre notare che l’encoding da html a stringa di testo non è quasi mai lineare, spesso occorre riformattare, cancellare spazi, convertire la natura dell’oggetto estratto etc. Il successivo elemento di complessità incontrato durante questa prima fase è stato interfacciarsi con un server attento alle richieste GET degli utenti. I dati viaggiano in pacchetti da un server che ospita un sito internet al nostro laptop. tutte le volte che cerchiamo di accedere ad un sito stiamo mandando una richiesta di ricezione di pacchetti dati ad un server in qualche luogo remoto del mondo. Quandi bussiamo alla porta del server se non siamo sospetti e superiamo i criteri autostabiliti dal server questo risponde, e lo fa con un numero che spazia da 200 a 500, due esempi: 200 se la risposta è positiva, 404 se la risposta è negativa. I criteri secondo cui gli utenti sono calssificati secondo utente normale o utente sospetto (aka bot) sono sintetizzati in un documento di testo chiamato robot.txt. Questo file di testo raccoglie tra le altre due infromazioni principali il delay time, cioè il tempo preferito dal server che deve intercorrere tra una richiesta dati e la successiva e quale utente è autorizzato ad accedere. Ogni utente posside un indirizzo IP che nelle richieste a server si codifica in user agent, cioè una stringa di testo dove vengono raccolte le infromzioni significative circa il dispositivo da cui provengono le richieste, un esempio: ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36’, dove ogni segmento della stringa rispecchia una caratteristica del laptop del richiedente, Chrome/54.0.2840.71 è la versione del browser chrome da cui proviene la richiesta Safari/537.36’, è il motore di ricerca etc. 2.2 Scraping Best Practices and Robot.txt Robots.txt files are (rivedi citation) a way to kindly ask webbots, spiders, crawlers, wanderers and the like to access or not access certain parts of a webpage. The de facto ‘standard’ never made it beyond a informal “Network Working Group INTERNET DRAFT”. Nonetheless, the use of robots.txt files is widespread (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt, https://www.google.com/robots.txt) and bots from Google, Yahoo and the like will adhere to the rules defined in robots.txt files, although their interpretation of those rules might differ. Robots.txt files are plain text and always found at the root of a website’s domain. The syntax of the files in essence follows a fieldname: value scheme with optional preceding user-agent: … lines to indicate the scope of the following rule block. Blocks are separated by blank lines and the omission of a user-agent field (which directly corresponds to the HTTP user-agent field) is seen as referring to all bots. # serves to comment lines and parts of lines. Everything after # until the end of line is regarded a comment. Possible field names are: user-agent, disallow, allow, crawl-delay, sitemap, and host. For further notions (Meissner and Ren 2020, @google:robottxt) Some interpretation problems: finding no robots.txt file at the server (e.g. HTTP status code 404) implies that everything is allowed subdomains should have there own robots.txt file if not it is assumed that everything is allowed redirects involving protocol changes - e.g. upgrading from http to https - are followed and considered no domain or subdomain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the - robots.txt file for the original domain redirects from subdomain www to the doamin is considered no domain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the robots.txt file for the subdomain originally requested For the thesis purposes it has been designed a dedicated function to inspect whether the domain requires specific actions or prevents some activity on thw target website. The following checkpermission() function has been integrated inside the scraping architecture and it is called once at the very beginning. library(robotstxt) dominio = &quot;immobiliare.it&quot; checkpermission = function(dom) { robot = robotstxt(domain = dom) vd = robot$check()[1] if (vd) { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt for&quot;, dom, &quot;is okay with scraping!&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt does not like what you&#39;re doing&quot;) ## stop() } } checkpermission(dominio) ## ## robot.txt for immobiliare.it is okay with scraping! Further improvements in this direction came from the polite package (Perepolkin 2019) which combines the power of the robotstxt, the ratelimitr to rate-limiting requests and the memoise for response caching. This package is wrapped up around 3 simple but effective ideas: The three pillars of a polite session are seeking permission, taking slowly and never asking twice. The three pillars constitute the Ethical web scraping manifesto (Densmore 2019) which are common shared practises that are aimed to self regularize scrapers. This has not nothing to do with law but since many scrapers themselves, as website administrators or analyst, have fought with bots. Bots might fake out real client logs and might stain analytics, so here it is born the choice to fine common ground and politely ask for permission. 2.3 User agents, Proxies, Handlers Everytime a user enters a website what he is really doing is sending an HTTP request to the website server with some information packed. This can be easily thought as a generic person A that rings the door’s bell of person B’s house. A comes to the B door with its personal information, its name, surname, where he lives etc. At this point B may either answer to A requests by opening the door and let him enter given the set of information he has, or it may not since B is not sure of the real intentions of A. This typical everyday situation in nothing more what happens billions of times on the internet everyday, the user (in the example above A) is interacting with a server website (part B) sending packets of information. If a server does not trust the information provided by the user, if the requests are too many, if the requests seems to be scheduled due to fixed sleeping time, a server can block the requests. In certain cases it can even forbid the user to be on the website. The language the two parties talks are coded in numbers that ranges from 100 to 511, each of which ha its own significance. A popular case of this type of interaction occurs when users are not connected to internet so the server responds 404, page not found. Servers are built with a immune-system like software that raises barriers and block users to prevent dossing or other illegal practices. How Web Works This procedure is a daily issue to people that are trying to collect information from websites. Google does it everyday with its spider crawlers, which are very sophisticated bots that performs scarping over a enormous range of websites. This challenge can be addressed in multiple ways, there are some specific Python packages that overcome this issue. The are also certain types of scraping as the Selenium web driver automation that simulates browser automation. Selenium allows the user not to be easily detected by the server immune system and peaceful. In here precautions have not been taken lightly, and a simple but effective approach is proposed. 2.3.1 User agents Spoofing A user agent (“User Agent: Learn Your Web Browsers User Agent Now” 2020) is a string of characters in each browser that serves as an identification agent. The user agent permits the web server to be able to identify the user operating system and the browser. Then, the web server uses the exchanged information to determine what content should be presented to particular operating systems and web browsers on a series of devices. The user agent string contains the user application or software, the operating system (and their versions), the web client, the web client’s version, and the web engine responsible for the content display (such as AppleWebKit). The user agent string is sent in form of a HTTP request header. Since the User Agents acts as middle man between the client request and the server response what it would be better doing is to actively faking it so that each time a web browser presents himself to a web server it has a different specifications, different web client, different operating system and so on. The simple approach followed was building a vector of samples of different existing and updated User Agents (UA). Then whenever a request from a browser is served to a web server 1 random string is drawn from the user agents pool. So each time the user is sending the requests it appears to have a different “identity”. Below the user agents rotating pool: set.seed(27) agents = c(&quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/602.2.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.1 Safari/602.2.14&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0&quot;) agents[sample(1)] ## [1] &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot; An improvement to this could be using also rotating proxies. A proxy server acts as a gateway between the user and the server. It’s an intermediary server himself, separating end clients from the websites they are browsing. Proxy servers provide varying layers of functionality, security, and privacy are some of the examples. While the user is exploiting a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the server you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. Many proxy servers are offered in a paid version so in this case since security barriers of the target website are not high they will not be implemented. It has to be mentioned that many online services are providing free proxies but the turnaround of this solutions are many, two of them are: - Proxies to be free are widely shared among people, so as long as someone has used them for illegal purposes the user is inheriting their mistakes when caught. - Some of those proxies, pretty all the ones coming from low ranked websites, are tracked so there might be a user privacy violation issue. 2.3.2 Handlers During the scraping many things could be going wrong. Starting from the things that have been previously explained at the chapter start (URL structure changes, data are moved in different location so that css query goes empty…), ending with the ones that have just been said a few lines ago. Handlers and trycatch error workarounds are explicitly built in this sense. The continuous testing of the scraping functioning while developing has required the maintainer to track where the error occurs. A few numbers: the “agglomerative” function get.data.catsing() triggers more than 36 scrapping functions that are going to catch 36 different data pieces. If one of them went missing then the other one would be missing too. Then when row-data is binded together one entry column might not exists making the process fail. Then the solution to that is to call inside the aggolmerative function as much as trycatch as many scrapping functions are involved. The trycatch can leverage the gap by introducing a specified quantity and alerting that something went wrong. On top of that many other handlers are called throughout the procedure: get_ua() verifies that the user agent coming from the session request is not the default one get_ua = function(sess) { stopifnot(is.session(sess)) stopifnot(is_url(sess$url)) ua = sess$response$request$options$useragent return(ua) } is_url() verifies that the url input needed has the canonic form. This is done by a REGEX query. is_url = function(url) { re = &quot;^(?:(?:http(?:s)?|ftp)://)(?:\\\\S+(?::(?:\\\\S)*)?@)?(?:(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)*(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;]){2,})(?::(?:\\\\d){2,5})?(?:/(?:\\\\S)*)?$&quot; grepl(re, url) } .get_delay() checks through the robotxt file if a delay between each request is kindly welcomed. .get_delay = function(domain) { message(sprintf(&quot;Refreshing robots.txt data for %s...&quot;, domain)) cd_tmp = robotstxt::robotstxt(domain)$crawl_delay if (length(cd_tmp) &gt; 0) { star = dplyr::filter(cd_tmp, useragent==&quot;*&quot;) if (nrow(star) == 0) star = cd_tmp[1,] as.numeric(star$value[1]) } else { 10L } } get_delay = memoise::memoise(.get_delay) 2.4 How rvest handles scraping To start a general scraping function it is required a target url. Then a html_session, which is the analogue of a GET request, is opened by specifying the url and the request data that the user need to send to the web server. httr is wrapped into rvest since it is the gold standard for server GET and POST requests. Information to be required have been already explored in the previous sections, they are: user agents, emails references and proxy servers. Once the connection is established (request response 200) all the following operations rely on this connection. The user from now, for the time being in the session, will be recognized with its own user agent. What it comes after is a succession of functions that follow a logical step by step path to get to the final information. rvest under the hood handles, in this precise order: reading the html structure of the web page, parsing this html content looking for a single node and then converting it into readable text. The entire process can be thought as sort of autoencoder by adding decoding layer after layer on top of the starting url, until reaching the final requested node. the reason why this come straightforward is given by the fact that rvest can be completely blended with the tidyverse logic, so the research for the exact node in the web page becomes very easy. The main functions that permits to perform the operations are: read_html() html_nodes() html_text(). Here below a function that scrapes the price and composes the API. scrapeprice.imm = function(session) { opensess = read_html(session) price = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&quot;.im-mainFeatures__title&quot;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if(is.null(price) || identical(price, character(0))) { price2 = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&#39;.im-features__value , .im-features__title&#39;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if (&quot;prezzo&quot; %in% price2) { pos = match(&quot;prezzo&quot;,price2) return(price2[pos+1]) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;€&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } else { return(NA_character_) } } else { return(price) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;€&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } } The function takes as a single argument a session which is established in one other function. Then It reads the session storing the informatiokn into an obj called the opensess. Another obj is created, namely price, right after the pipe operator a css query into the html is called. The css query .im-mainFeatures__title points to a precise data stored in immobiliare web page header, right below the main title. Expectation are that price is a one-element chr vector, containing the price and some other unnecessary characters. Then the algorithm enters into the first if statement. The handler checks is the object price is empty. If it doesn’t the algorithm jumps to the end and returns the cleaned quantity. But If it does it takes again the opensess and redirect to a second css query .im-features__value , .im-features__title where price, once again, could be found. Please note that This is all done within the same session, so no more request information has to be sent. Since the latter css query points to data stored inside a list, for the time being the newly created obj price2 is a list containing various information. Then the flow enters into the second if statement that checks whether \"prezzo\" is in the list or not, if it does it returns the +1 position index element with respect to the “prezzo” positioning. This happens because data in price2 list are stored by couples sequentially, say: [title, “Appartamento Sempione”, energy class, “G”, “prezzo”, 1200/al mese]. When it returns the element corresponding to +1 position index it applies also some data wrangling with stringr to keep out overabundant characters. The function then escapes in the else statement by setting price2 = NA_Character_. the Character quality has to be imposed due to fact that if the function is evaluated for a url and returns a quantity x and then is evaluated for url2 and outputs NA (no character) then results can not be combined into dataframe. The skeleton shown can be shared among the other scraping functions, what it changes is the item “prezzo” which is then replaced by other covariates reasearched, say energy class etc. Moreover some other functions need to have heavy cleaning steps in order to be usable. As a consequence functions need also to be broken down into pieces by single .R files, so that they can be adapted with respect to their singular necessities. Once all the functions have been created they need to be called together and then data coming after them need to be combined. This is done by get,data.catsing() which at first checks the validity of the url, then takes the same url as input and filters it as a session object. Then simultaneously all the functions are called and then combined. All this happens inside a foreach parallel loop called by scrape.all.info() scrape.all.info = function(url = &quot;https://www.immobiliare.it/affitto-case...&quot;, vedi = FALSE, scrivi = FALSE, silent = FALSE){ if (silent) { start = as_hms(Sys.time()); cat(&#39;Starting the process...\\n\\n&#39;) message(&#39;\\nThe process has started in&#39;,format(start,usetz = TRUE)) } # open parallel multisession cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) #using max cores - 1 for parallel processing registerDoParallel(cl) start = as_hms(Sys.time()) if (silent) { message(&#39;\\n\\nStart all the requests at time:&#39;, format(start,usetz = T)) } ALL = foreach(i = seq_along(links), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .multicombine = FALSE, .export =&quot;links&quot; , .verbose = TRUE, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;utils.R&quot;) sourceEntireFolder(&quot;functions_singolourl&quot;) get.data.catsing = function(singolourl){ # dormi() # if(!is_url(singolourl)){ stop(paste0(&quot;The following url does not seem either to exist or it is invalid&quot;, singolourl)) } session = html_session(singolourl, user_agent(agents[sample(1)])) if (class(session) == &quot;session&quot;) { session = session$response } id = tryCatch({scrapehouse.ID(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapehouse.ID&quot;) }) lat = tryCatch({scrapelat.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelat.imm&quot;) }) long = tryCatch({scrapelong.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelong.imm&quot;) }) location = tryCatch({take.address(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in take.address&quot;) }) condom = tryCatch({scrapecondom.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapecondom.imm&quot;) }) buildage = tryCatch({scrapeagebuild.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapeagebuild.imm&quot;) }) ... combine = tibble(ID = id, LAT = lat, LONG = long, LOCATION = location, CONDOM = condom, BUILDAGE = buildage, ... return(combine) } stopCluster(cl) return(ALL) } 2.5 How functions are designed The way scraping functions are oriented walks around three main key programming concepts: Continuous integration and easy debugging Intuitive structure Fasten process with respect to the goal of acquiring data Functions are explicitly designed to respond to continuous changes and to handle fails. They need to be dynamic otherwise they would not be able to always get the content. Since none can predict whether a system administrator will change the page layout or not, the scrapping is disassembled into x number of functions. x is the number of data available and covariates for the model even tough some of the function extracts more than one covariates. In such a way the maintainer can easily adjust the failing function by accessing through it. Starting from the url where advertisements (25 per web page) are it can be created all the following url since it is necessary to append the “&amp;page = 1”, “&amp;page = 2” and so. Once they are collected into an object the firs scraping function can be processed given that in this urls. levelName 1 immobiliare.it-WebScraping 2 ¦--functions_singolourl 3 ¦ ¦--0scrapesqfeetINS.R 4 ¦ ¦--0scrapenroomINS.R 5 ¦ ¦--0scrapepriceINS.R 6 ¦ ¦--0scrapetitleINS.R 7 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAdDate.R 8 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAge.R 9 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAgeBuilding.R 10 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAirConditioning.R 11 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAptChar.R 12 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCatastInfo.R 13 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCompart.R 14 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCondom.R 15 ¦ ¦--ScrapeContr.R 16 ¦ ¦--ScrapeDisp.R 17 ¦ ¦--ScrapeEnClass.R 18 ¦ ¦--ScrapeFloor.R 19 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHasMulti.R 20 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHeating.R 21 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseID.R 22 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseTxtDes.R 23 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLAT.R 24 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLONG.R 25 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLoweredPrice.R 26 ¦ ¦--ScrapeMetrature.R 27 ¦ ¦--ScrapePhotosNum.R 28 ¦ ¦--ScrapePostAuto.R 29 ¦ ¦--ScrapePropType.R 30 ¦ ¦--ScrapeReaReview.R 31 ¦ ¦--ScrapeStatus.R 32 ¦ ¦--ScrapeTotPiani.R 33 ¦ ¦--ScrapeType.R 34 ¦ °--take_location.R 35 ¦--scrapeALL.R 36 ¦--scrapeALLINFO.R 37 ¦--functions_url 38 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHREF.R 39 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrice.R 40 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrimaryKey.R 41 ¦ ¦--ScrapeRooms.R 42 ¦ ¦--ScrapeSpace.R 43 ¦ °--ScrapeTitle.R 44 ¦--libs.R 45 ¦--utils.R 46 ¦--README.Rmd 47 ¦--README.md 48 °--simulations 49 ¦--rt_match_vs_forloop.R 50 °--runtime_simul.R 2.5.1 From Generic and Specific structure functional structure 2.5.2 Parallel Computing Since many html sessions are opened and within each session many requests are sent computations can take a while. For the sake of the analysis and the app this should not bother the end user because scraping tasks are performed daily and a single day is sufficient amount of runtime. In any case functions are optimized following the criteria stated before. Run time is crucial when dealing with time series and time to market in real estate is very important, this leads to have always fresh data. A way to secure fresh new data is to have lightweight computation on a single machine o heavy computation divided among a bunch of different machines, in this case sessions. All the following runtime examinations are performed on the scrape.all functions. A first attempt was using furrr package (Vaughan and Dancho 2018) which enables mapping through a list with the purrr , along with a future parallel backend. This has shows decent results, but its run time increases when more requests are sent. This leads to a preventive conclusion about the computational complexity: it has to be at least linear. Empirical demonstrations have been made: library(furrr) vecelaps = c() start = c() end = c() for (i in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start[i] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;, i, &quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) list.of.pages.imm[1:i] %&gt;% furrr::future_map(get.data.caturl, .progress = T) %&gt;% bind_rows() end[i] = Sys.time() vecelaps[i] = end[i] - start[i] } furrrmethod = tibble(start, end, vettoelaps) # ggplot (themed) run time meausurament method 1 p = ggplot(furrrmethod,aes(x=1:20, y=vettoelaps)) + geom_line( color=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Num URLS evaluated&quot;) + ylab(&quot;run time (in seconds)&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Run-Time for First method (furrr multisession)&quot;) + stat_smooth(method=lm) + theme_nicco() p computational complexity analysis with Furrr On the x-axis the number of urls evaluated together, iteration after iteration the urls considered are increased by one. On the y-axis the time measured in seconds. Looking at the smoothing curve in between an easy guess might be linear time \\(O(n)\\). A second attempt tried to explore the foreach package (Microsoft and Weston 2020). This interesting package enables a new looping construct for executing R code in an iterative way. With all the variety of existing (apply, lapply, sapply, eapply, mapply, rapply,) looping constructs, it might be doubted that there is a need for yet another construct. The main reason for using the foreach package is that it supports parallel execution, that is, it can execute those repeated operations on multiple processors/cores on the computer, or on multiple nodes of a cluster. The construction is straightforward: start clusters on processors cores define the iterator, in this case i = to the elements that are going to be iterated through .packages: Inherits the packages that are used in the tasks define below .combine: Define the combining function that bind results at the end (say cbind, rbind or tidyverse::bind_rows). It has to be a string. .errorhandling: specifies how a task evaluation error should be handle. %dopar%: the dopar keyword suggests foreach with parallelization method then the function within the elements are iterated close clusters One major important thing concerns the fact that th function within iterators repeats itself should be standalone. For standalone it is meant that the body function should be defined inside, as it would be a an empty environment. As a matter of fact packages has to be taken inside each time, and if the function is not defined inside body (or is not source from some other locations) the clusters can not operate and an error is printed. cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) registerDoParallel(cl) vettoelaps1 = c() start1 = c() end1 = c() for (j in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start1[j] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;,j,&quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) foreach(i = seq_along(list.of.pages.imm[1:j]), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;main.R&quot;) x = get.data.caturl(list.of.pages.imm[i]) } end1[j] = Sys.time() vettoelaps1[j] = end1[j] -start1[j] } stopCluster(cl) computational complexity analysis with Furrr It can be seen quite easily that the curve is flattened and resembles someway logarithmic time \\(O(log(n))\\). A further improvement could be obtained using a new package called doAzureParallel which is built on top of foreach. doAzureParallel enables different Virtual Machines operates parallel computing throughout Microsoft Azure cloud, but this comes at a substantial monetary cost. This would be a perfect match given that parallel methods seen before accelerates the number of requests sent among different processors or cluster, even though actually what it is really needed it is something that separates session. Unleashing Virtual Machines permits from one hand to further increase computational power and the number of potential requests, from the other it can splits requests among different user agents (a pool for each VM) masquerading even better the scraping automation. 2.6 What are the Advantages of this Workflow 2.7 Legal Challenges (ancora non validato) “Data that are online and public are always available for all” is never a good answer to the question “Can I use that data to my scope”. Immobiliare.it is not providing any source of data from its own database neither it is planning to do so in the future. It has not even provided a paid API through which might be possible to perform analysis. However the golden standard for scraping was respected since the robot.txt file is clear allowing any actions as demonstrated above. What it worth noting is that some other popular player other like Idealista is using a different approach. Some of procedures that has been applied to the immboliare scraping was not possibile on the Idealista. This could be due to many reason: Idealista content is composed by Javascript so and html parser can no get that. Idealista blocks also certain web browser that have a demonstrated “career” in scraping procedures. All of this leads to accept that entry barriers to scrape are for sure higher than the one faced for Immobiliare. The reticence to share data could be a reflex on how big idealista is; as a matter of fact it has a heavy market presence in some of the Europe real estates country as Spain and France. So what they thought was to raise awareness on scraping procedure that in a certain way can hurt their business. This has been validated by the fact that prior filtering houses on their website a checkbox has to be signed. The checkbox make the user sign an agreement on their platform according to which data can not be misused and it belongs their intellectual property. References "]
