Data as such can monitor a vast range of natural or economic measurements, as example cancer detection (Bell et al. 2006) at several sites, COVID19 spread in China (Li et al. 2020) etc. Distance between observations can generate correlation as well. As a further argument house prices smoothly varies between close neighborhoods (Gómez Rubio 2020). All the Examples taken before might document a spatial nature of data according to which closer observations can display similar values, this phenomenon is named spatial autocorrelation. Spatial models are explicitly designed to take into account this behavior and can separate spatial patterns from simply random spatial variance. APi generated data are point referenced data, so modeling methodologies applied regard only the just introduced data type. As a side note spatial data can be distinguished into 3 main categories: areal data: point referenced data point pattern data Spatial data can also be measured according to a 3rd dimension (4th where there is elevation) which is time. In this settign it might be interesting to research time correlation between subsequent spatial data time points (Paci et al. 2017). What It can be observed in point reference data type is just a sample, some sites, from a continuous unobserved spatial process 6.1 which we aim to estimate. 3D scatterplot and surface, Stockton data. 6.1 Gaussian Process (GP) For simplicity lets consider \\(y\\) of interest observations \\(y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\\right),y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\right)\\) from a random spatial process \\(Y\\), such that: \\(Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\\right),Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\\right), \\ldots, Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\right)\\) observed at location \\(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\). In the context of geostatistical data each observation, once again, has to be considered as a partial realization of an unobserved random spatial process. \\(\\left\\{Y(s): s \\in D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right\\}\\) , where \\(D\\) is a subset of r-dimensional Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r}\\). When \\(r = 1\\) it is a simple stochastic process widely explored in literature i.e. time series process. Nevertheless geostatistical data belong always to \\(r = 2\\) or eventually \\(r = 3\\), when elevation dataa is available. The stochastic process \\(Y\\) is observed in a fixed set of “monitoring stations” and inference can be done regarding moments of the realized process. This information are essential to build a spatially continuous surface over the y-studied variable in order to predict the phenomenon at locations not yet observed. A \\(Y\\) random spatial process is said to be a GP if for any set of spatial index \\(n\\) and for each set of corresponding locations \\(\\left(y\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(s_{n}\\right)\\right)\\) follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\left(\\mu\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\mu\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\right)\\right)\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) (Marta Blangiardo 2015). The covariance matrix relates each observation to each others by a spatial covariance function defined as \\(\\mathcal{C}(\\cdot)\\), such that \\(\\Sigma_{i j}=\\operatorname{Cov}\\left(y\\left(s_{i}\\right), y\\left(s_{j}\\right)\\right)=\\mathcal{C}\\left(y\\left(s_{i}\\right), y\\left(s_{j}\\right)\\right)\\). GP has to meet two important properties: it has to be stationary and it has to be isotropic. 6.1.1 Stationarity in GP Stationarity in a stochastic process can be either strong or weak. The strong assumption forces that for any given spatial index \\(n\\) and its correspondent locations \\(s_{1,\\ldots,n}\\), the distribution of the process \\(\\left\\{Y\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\ldots, Y\\left(s_{n}\\right)\\right\\}\\) is the same of the one in \\(\\left\\{y\\left(s_{1}+\\boldsymbol{h}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}+\\boldsymbol{h}\\right)\\right\\}\\), where \\(h\\) is a number belonging to \\(R^{2}\\). The latter (i.e, weak) ensures that if the GP mean moment is constant over the study domain \\(\\mu(\\mathbf{s}) \\equiv \\mu\\) (e.g. \\(E[Y(s)]=\\mu, \\forall s \\in D\\)) then the covariance functions does depend only on the distance between each couple points (euclidean \\(\\left\\|s_{i}-s_{j}\\right\\|\\) distance) separation. Distance choice is a major subject but for simplicity Euclidean has been selected. Weak stationarity consequences are that It does not matter whether observations are placed either in a specific region, nor the direction towards they are oriented, the covariance functions \\(\\mathcal{C}(h)\\) can summarize the process through the separation vector \\(h\\) (Banerjee 2015). Moreover since it is assumed to be true \\(E[Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s})]=0\\), the second moment of the latter expression can be written as \\(E[Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s})]^{2}\\) leading to also \\(\\operatorname{Var}(Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s}))\\). Last expression is called variogram and can be expressed with \\(2 \\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\), even tough its half is more often used and \\(\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\) is named semivariogram (Cressie 2015). The intuition behind this expression is that the difference in value between two near points \\(Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})\\) and \\(Y(\\mathbf{h})\\) is expected to be small with respect to the ones farther, in compliance with the first law of geography by Tobler: “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” variogram example Semivariograms are an efficient tool to asses spatial continuity but they are theoretical. However semivariograms can be fitted to existing data giving birth to empirical semivariograms which are then plotted against their separation vector. The plot can be used to verify the null hypothesis of spatial independence and variability of the process. The below expression is the empirical semivariogram functional form: \\[\\hat{\\gamma}(t)=\\frac{1}{2}|N(t)| \\sum_{\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}, \\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right) \\in N(t)}\\left(Y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)-Y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\] where \\(N(t)\\) is the set of location pairs such that \\(\\left\\|\\mathbf{s}_{i}-\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right\\|=t\\) and so \\(|N(t)|\\) is the number of pairs in the set. As already guessed before empirical semivariogram values are expected to be small at short pairs distance and tends to increase when distance increases. The rational behind is that similar observations are expected to lay close together (small \\(h\\)) leading to lower semivariogram values (\\(\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\)), as opposite farther pairs obervations (big \\(h\\)) tend to be different and associated to greater semivariogram values. Flat semivariogram might indicate small spatial variance, since whether distance \\(h\\) increases or not, semivariogram values remains the same \\(\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})}{\\Delta\\mathbf{h}}\\approx0\\). Semivariograms might be also implied earlier in the modeling process to to evaluate the presence of any spatial pattern. Then They are implied also later in the final stage of modelling process with the aim to asses if any spatial pattern in still present in the residuals. The three main arguments in semivariograms are: range \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), nugget \\(\\tau^{2}\\) and sill \\(\\tau^{2}+\\sigma^{2}\\). [parameters explanation] 6.1.2 Matérn covariance function There are many covariance functions and their application depends both on data and the scope on the analysis. Examples of spatial covariance functions are: Linear, Spherical, Exponential and Matérn. FIgure below shows the amount of differen covariance function Matérn displays higher degree of flexibility and it can be accounted as the most used in geostatistics (Krainski et al. 2018) and (Gómez Rubio 2020), therefore it will be implied in later the model building process. Matérn functional is: \\[ C_{\\nu}(d)=\\sigma^{2} \\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\nu} \\frac{d}{\\rho}\\right)^{\\nu} K_{\\nu}\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\nu} \\frac{d}{\\rho}\\right) \\] where \\(d\\) is the between point distance, \\(\\Gamma(\\cdot)\\) is a gamma function and \\(K_{\\nu}(\\cdot)\\) is a modified Bessel function \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\nu\\) are common shared parameters explained few lines below. 6.1.3 Isotropy in GP The process is said to be Isotropic if the covariance function depends only on the between-points distance so it is invariant under rotation (Krainski 2019). If the last assumption does not hold and direction towards point are distant from each other in the spatial domain \\(D\\) then the process is said to be Anisotropic. 6.2 Hedonic class models for Rental House Market The theoretical foundation of the Hedonic Price Models (from now on HPM) relies on the consumer utility theory of Lancaster’s (1966) and in Rosen’s model [Rosen, 1974]. The general principle in HPM suggests that the value of a commodity can be calculated by the estimated values of its separate properties. Applying HPM to real estate, house pricing (also renting) is given by the unit cost of each household characteristic, therefore the expenditures associated with them. More generally the discussion might be also opened to how much adding a household expenditure impacts the total price of the house [letteratura]. It can be also extended to how much a new infrastructure (transports, new public places) will drive house price value [letteratura]. Both of the two points mentioned are interesting research prospects but are beyond the scope of the analysis. According to HPM Hedonic Price function establishes a general functional relationship between the observed household expenditures on housing, \\(P(C)\\), and the level of characteristics contained in vector \\(C\\). \\(P(C)=f\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)\\). A first attempt to include spatial effect in urban economic literature is provided by Alonso (1964). Its contribution was to raise voice on house prices (also rent) mainly depending on land price and a number of purely spatial covariates like CBD, the distance from City Business District. Other covariates were transport cost per kilometer and community income, even though they were defined also as spatial parameters through distances. The model proposed by Alonso is called monocentric since the centroid from which distances are calculated is only one. Moreover a first touch to spatial data thory was done since the CBD was defined as areal unit with well-defined boundaries of regular or irregular shape. However Applications of the model were not convincing since obervations offered a different picture. Results instead displayed a Poly-centric areal structure (universities and Malls) which might have driven prices. The model also assumed that covariates like CBD are only informative within city center boundaries and then displayed no significance out of the core of the city. Poly-centric theory was also more coherent with the architectural and socio-economical evolution of cities during recent times, therefore mono centric theory was then criticized and abandoned. Critics regarded also neighborhood quality measure and boundary problems Dubin (1987). Dubin for these reasons developed a geostatistical model including areal effects in the error term since handling these covariates was posing several hard challenges. Here relies part of the reason why the problem in this analysis is approached as point reference and not as areal. During literature evolution on HPM, as it is already been explained, discussions on vector \\(C\\) have risen. Though generally they can be grouped into two macro domains: Residential structure characteristics, such as: house size, and the number of rooms, number of bathrooms (inner data effect) Effects associated with the geographic location (locational effects), both between houses and within other existing infrastructures, events or areas. (outer data effect) For the scope of the analysis residential structure covariates and locational between houses effects are considered. Exogenous effects such as crime rate and transports are not included in the model since prices and rents are already incorporating that information. As a final remark scholars would argue that rent values do not represent the actual value of real estate. Nevertheless in empirical analysis rent value are considered a proxy for the price of real estate (Herath and Maier 2011). A further argument to endorse this hypothesis is brought by (Manganelli, Morano, and Tajani 2013) considering housing a commodity, then the selling or the rental should be considered interchangeable economic actions with respect to same inner need to satisfy. This is also stronger in this case since the latter statement is referred to a paper exclusively based on italian real estate analysis. Moreover Capozza and Seguin (Capozza and Seguin 1996) discussed about how much rent-price ratio predicts future changes both in rents and prices. Among other issues raised they pinpointed the decomposition of rent-price ratio into two parts: the predictable part and the unexplained residuals part. The predictable part was in negative relationship with price changes, in other words cities in which prices are relatively high with respect to rents are associated with higher capital gains that justifies that misalignment. This is also true for the opposite, that is cities in which prices are higher with respect to the rents, and this can not be associated to any local condition, realizes lower capital gains. One other demonstration of price-rent exchangeablity and strong correlation is offered by Clark (Clark 1995) which traces the Capozza and Seguin work. Rent-price ratio is negatively correlated with following future changes in rents. In other words prices are still higher when areas in which they are observed documents an increase in rent prices. All the literature review above is oriented to a long-run alignement of price and rent. 6.3 Hierarchical regression for univariate spatial data Since the relationships between the characteristics of the house, i.e. vector \\(C\\), and the price is not defined in economic literature it is possible to assume any \\(f\\) functional form [linear non linear functional]. The open possibility to apply any relationship between covariates comes very handy in the INLA setting (latentGaussian) since latent gaussian models are prepared to accept any \\(f\\) relation. Urban econometric literature transform the price variable to a logarithmic scale, this transformation smooths the skewness of prices leading to best estimates. This argumentation can be taken also for prices regarding house rents. If it assumed a linear relationship among covariates then a classical bayesian non-spatial linear regression can relate a \\(log(y)\\) response variable with its covariates and error through the expression: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log(y_{i})=\\mu_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{i}\\) is normally distributed as \\(y_{i} \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma^{2}\\right)\\) and \\(\\mu_{i}\\) is the mean structure that might linearly depend on some \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) covariates, \\(\\beta\\) coefficients and \\(\\varepsilon\\) white noise error. Keeping in mind the INLA notation, the linear predictor can be written as \\(\\eta_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_{j} x_{i m}\\), where the \\(i\\) pedix is the observation number and the \\(j\\) pedix is the mth covariate. Moreover it is possible to specify \\(\\eta\\) as a function of \\(\\mu\\). The link function between them in this case is identity, so that \\(\\eta_{i}=g\\left(\\mu_{i}\\right)=\\mu_{i}\\). In GLMs when response variable has to stay between \\([0,1]\\) (e.g. probabilities), the link function might be Logit, which leads to logistic regression. More generally expressed in vector notation: \\[\\begin{equation} y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{x}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)^{\\prime} \\beta_{j}+\\varepsilon\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right) \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] where its OLS estimator is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] However in many cases non-linear functions, like basis function might be a smoother solution to model coordinates when used as covariates (Krainski et al. 2018). Moreover In the context of bayesian analysis a prior distribution has to be imposed on the regression coefficients \\(\\beta = \\left\\{\\beta_{0}, \\ldots, \\beta_{J}\\right\\}\\) as well ad on the variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) of \\(y_{i}\\). When no expert information is provided vague priors are introduced, meaning that the regression should not be weighted too much on the priors choice. Vague priors might be: \\(\\beta_{m} \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}\\left(0,10^{6}\\right)\\) for the beta coefficients \\(\\log (\\tau)=\\log \\left(1 / \\sigma^{2}\\right) \\sim \\log \\operatorname{Gamma}\\left(1,10^{-5}\\right)\\) for precision When leveraging information from location the added \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) has to be introduced in the previous equation (6.2). \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) surface is required in order to incroporate spartial infromation into regression settings, as well as enabling prediction over the domanin \\(D\\): \\[y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{x}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}+w(\\mathbf{s})+\\varepsilon\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)\\] The \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) in the context of the analysis is approached as a GP6.1 whose distribution is multivariate with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\mathbf{s})\\) and function of the spatial index \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\). \\(\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{s})\\) is iid and mean centered in 0 with variance \\(\\tau^{2}\\) and is called non-spatial error since it contributes to the nugget. The error term is nit pure since it interfers with the covariance function so the model can be fully spatial. One of the major advantges of having a a spatial process embedded into a GP is likelihood based inference. References "]
