Niccolò Salvini date: Last compiled on 23 ottobre, 2020 Preliminary Content Abstract This thesis has the aim to asses the problem of setting a price for monthly rents in Milan Real Estate taking into consideration inner and outer factors. This is done by exploiting scheduled scraping techniques wrapped into an API (plumber). The API is then added into a docker container and served with AWS EC2 instance. On the other side a Shiny application calls the endpoints gathering geospatial data. The application back end integrates in the its server part a bayesian spatial models. INLA is the computing choice. Visualization are rendered with rayshader. Acknowledgements First of all I acknowledge a special debt to Professor Della Vedova who has patently followed me during this 6 months long journey, he has encouraged me and let me try things never done before. Our communication through this process has always been transparent and each moment spent was a lesson to learn. I came with strong ideas to his office desk and he let me shape my dissertation giving me blank paper. Most of all when something was not working he has always been keen to solve and suggest a better approach. I owe a lot also to Dr. Vincenzo Nardelli, he is one of the kindest and most talented guys I have ever met. I took a big inspiration by its works. He has been a true street opener to me, he introduced me to web scraping, then to our newly born social platform Data Network and then to the Spatial Statistics. Sometimes I feel like I am copying him, but then I realize that it is inspiration. I owe also a huge thanks to professor Lucia Paci. She has been one of the top teacher in my master course to me by far. She has the capability to explain very hard stuff with ease without omitting anything. She narrowed my path through bayesian methods for spatial statistics, since she was co-author of one of the main book references that I got. The bayesian statistical part relies on her thoughts and on her experience on the subject. I will not for sure miss to thank my beautiful girlfriend Elisabetta, She has seen my darkest times and my deepest insecurities, she did not even blink and she kept helping me like day one. Without her really anything would not have been even possible. She is so smart and she know me so well that when I had downs, even though she had had her own issues, she carried the weights and broght the only medicine I know: Sciacchiata o Gelato. I would love to thank my father Muzio to be such a big milestone both in my career and private life, he has always encouraged me pursuing my dream by never setting any sort of limit. Its life could be compressed into a Frank Sinatra song My Way and observing him, working speakly, I wish the future would bless me with its same independence and freedom. Special thanks are dedicated also to my beloved uncles, zia Jolanda and zio Luciano. They put a stake on me, they always make me feel special and talented even though university has never given me the chance to truly express myself. Me and Zio Luciano conversations are inspirational, he knows all the ropes, he is the most talented business man I am ever going to see in my entire life, I wish I could have a tenth of its talent. What I do is mainly because of its enormous successes and sacrifices. Memory is just for people that have to rely on past to act in the present. You take care of today so that tomorrow you can shape the future. Zia Jolanda you gave me back the most important thing, family, you have never missed special and difficult moments. You supported me and my mother throughout our exhausting journey I would never find the words and express much gratitude for what you did. You are an angel. To all my friend thanks for each of your unspecified different support, unfortunately this is becoming too long, a party is going to happen and a piece of a paper will do justice. Dedication To my beloved mother, Maria Cristina. She has done so much for me you would not even know. We have been facing fires and flames for God knows how long, and now look where we are. You can not imagine how strong she is and if you do it please try to explain me then. I have always thought that mothers have this type of superpowers, but I belive me my mother exaggerates. Our relationship has never been easy, we have both of us strong attitudes, nevertheless we keep on persisting and the reason is that we can not be set apart. Never. The most I have done since I remember is for her and for her satisfaction. I do not regret it. She is my inspiration, and I hope someday that I will live up to you mamma. she went all in sending me in Milan. She did right. Mums always right. keywords : Bayesian Statistics, RESTFUL API, Shiny, Docker, AWS EC2, INLA, Real Estate, Web Scraping, Parallel Computing, Cron Job Scheduler.

It can be done automatically and simultaneously as well as by a scheduler that palns its execution at a given time. Due to the absence of APIs to call regarding Milan Real Estate rental markets, this practice has to be forcly applied. The reason behind that and personal hope is to open source the scraping API so that in the future further analysis will be available without putting effort in gathering data fresh data. Content distribution is managed by HTTP protocols, which are a common standard to connect web clients. Web browsers (i.e. one among the others web clients) download the content and parses them making possible to read them_The athomical unit of measurement in scraping is the url, which are the locations where this data exchanges abstractly happens. [ questo in API infra ] Data/content in webpages is the most of the times well organized and accessible by urls. This is made possible by the effort put into building both the website structure and the content architecture. For website structure it is meant the way urls, pointing to webpages, are arranged throughout the website. Website structure constitutes a first dimension of hierarchy. Some popular structures examples might regard social-networks where posts can be scrolled down within a single page named the wall. Scrolling down might end due to fewer posts, but the perception is a never-ending webpage associated to a single url. Instead personal profiles are dedicated to a specified unique url and even in profiles posts are allocated into a sub domain and might be scrolled down arranged by time since the day of social subscription. Online newspapers display their articles in the front wall and by accessing to one of them all the related following articles sometimes can be reached by an arrow, pointing right or left. Articles can also be suggested and the more the website is explored the more articles are likely to be seen twice within the same session. It will soon end up into a suggestion loop that it will recursively shows the same contents; recursive structures are popular in newspaper-type websites. Online Retailers as Amazon, based on filters, groups inside a single webpage (i.e. page n° 1) a fixed set of items, having their dedicated personal url attached to them. Furthermore Amazon offers the opportunity to skip to the following page (i.e. page n° 2), searching for another different and fixed set of items and so on until the last page/url. Generally website structures try to reflect both the user expectations with respect to the product on the website and the design expression of the web developer. For these reasons for each websites usage category exists a multitude of content architectures. For each content architectures there are multiple front end languages which are destinated to multiple end users. In the future expectations are tailor made webpages on users with respect to its personal preferences. Moreover web design in scraping plays an important role since the more sophisticated graphical technologies are implied, the harder will be to scrape information. general website structure A second dimension of hierarchy is brought by content architecture in the name of the language used for content creation and organization i.e. HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and  HTML drives the hierarchy structure that is then generalized to the website structure. According to this point of view the hierarchical website structure is a consequence of the content architecture by means of HTML language ( arborescence: direction from root to leaves). CSS language stands for Cascading Style Sheets and takes care of the style of the webpage. The combination of HTML and CSS offers a wide flexibility in building web sites, once again expressed by the vast amount of different designs on the web. Some websites components also might be tuned by Javascript language, which in the context of scraping adds a further layer of difficulty. As a matter of fact since Javascript components are dynamic within the webpage, scraping requires specialized libraries to enable different parser to get the content. CSS allows the scraper to target a class of objects in the web page that shares same style (e.g. same css query) so that each element that belongs to the class (i.e. share same style) can be gathered. This practice provides enormous advantages since by CSS a set of objects can be obtained within a single function call. First and Second dimension of the scraping problem imply hierarchy, a simple way to approach the problem is to represent it through already known data structures. One way to imagine hierarchy in both of the two dimensions are graph based data structures named as Rooted Trees. By analyzing the first dimension through the lenses of Rooted trees it is possible to compress the whole problem into the general graph based jargon (Diestel 2006). Rooted trees must start with a root node which is the domain of the web page. Each Node is a url destination and each Edge is the connection between nodes. Connections have been made possible in the website by nesting urls inside webpages so that within a single webpage the user can access to a number of other related links. Furthermore, as an extension to the rooted tree framework a general graph theory component is introduced, i.e. the Weight. Each edge is associated to a weight whose interpretation is the run time cost to walk from a node to its conncted other nodes (e.g. from a url to the other). In addition the content inside each node takes the name of payload, which ultimately is the scope of the scraping processes. The walk from node 17 to node 8 in figure below (even though that is the case of a binary rooted tree) is called path and it represented as an ordered list of nodes connected by edges. In this context each node can have both a fixed and variable outgoing sub-nodes that are called Children . When root trees have a fixed set of children are called k-ary rooted trees. A node is said to be Parent to other nodes when it is connected to them by outgoing edge, in right figure below head is the parent of nodes title and meta. Nodes in the tree that shares the same parent node are said Siblings, head and body are siblings in figure @ref(tree_html). Moreover Subtrees are a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and its descendants e.g. node body with all of its descendants might constitute a subtree. The concept of subtree in both of the dimensions plays crucial role in cutting run time scraping processes and fake headers provision (see section 2.3.1). If the website strucuture is locally reproducible and the content architecture within webpages tends to be equal, then functions for a single subtree might be extended to the rest of others subtrees that are siblings to the same parent node. Local reproducibility is a property according to which starting from a single url all the related urls can be inferred from a pattern. Equal content architecture throughout different single links means to have sort of standard shared-within advs criteria that each single rental advertisement has to refer. In addition two more metrics have might better describe the tree: level and height. The level of a node \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) counts the number of edges on the path from the root node to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). The height is the maximum level for any node in the tree, from now on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). What is worth to be anticipating is that functions are not going to be applied directly to siblings in the more general rooted tree. Instead it would be better segmenting the highest level rooted tree into a sequence of single subtrees whose roots are the siblings for reasons explained in section 2.3.1. html_tree 2.1.1 Immobiliare.it Webscraping website structure The structure of the website resembles the one encountered for the popular online retailer Amazon. According to the query filters (e.g. number of rooms 5, price less than 600 p.m. etc), the url is shaped so that each further filter added is appened at the end to the domain url https://www.immobiliare.it/ root node (see figure below). Once filters are all applied to the root domain this constitutes the new url root domain node that might have this appereance: https://www.immobiliare.it/affitto-case/milano/?criterio=rilevanza&amp;superficieMinima=60. Sinced this is true only for page n°1 and contains the first 25 advs all the remaining siblings nodes corresponding to next pages have to be generated. Here comes handy the Local reproducibility property introduced in the previous section. The rest of the siblings, i.e. the ones belonging to page 2 (with the attached 25 advs) and to page 3 can be generated by appending &amp;pag=n at the end of the url, where n is the page number reference (from now on referred as pagination). For page number 4 the exact url that points to the web page, being equal the filters from above, is https://www.immobiliare.it/affitto-case/milano/?criterio=rilevanza&amp;superficieMinima=60&amp;pag=4. Author customary choice is to stop pagination up to 300 pages since spatial data can not be to large due to computational burdens. Moreover thanks to the reverse engineer applied to url building tree height \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is pruned, so the parsing part is cut short. At this point pagination has generated a list of siblings urls whose children number is fixed (i.e. 25 per page). That makes those trees k-ary, where k is 25 indicating the number of children. K-ary trees with equal content structure shared across siblings allow to design a single function to call that could be mapped to all the other siblings. In addition in order to further disassemble the website and making available the whole set of single rental advertisement links for each page (ranging from 1 to 300) a specific function has been made. As a consequence a single function call scrape_href() can grab all the links inside page 1. The function is then iterated along all the previously generated siblings (i.e. pages) obtaining a collection of all the single ads links belonging to the set of pages generated. website_tree children_str 2.1.2 Immobiliare.it Webscraping content architecture with rvest To start a general scraping function it is required a target url (i.e. the filtered root node url). Then a html_session nested list object is opened by specifying the url and the request data that the user need to send to the web server (see left part to dashed line image ??). Information to be attached to the web server request will be further explored later, tough they are mainly three: User Agents, emails references and proxy servers. html_session objects contains a number of useful information such as: the url, the response, coockies, session times etc. Once the connection is established (request response 200) all the following operations rely on the opened session, in other words for the time being in the session the user will be authorized with the before-provided characteristics through the request. The list object contains mostly the html content of the webpage and that is where data needs to be parsed and collected. The list as said can disclose other interesting metadata that might be interesting but is beyond the scope of the analysis. The workflow below schematize what scraping is doing: workflow In the right part of the dashed vertical line is represented a sequence of rvest(Wickham 2019) functions that follow a general step by step text comprehension rules. rvest first handles parsing the html content of the web page within the session object read_html(), secondly looking for a single node html_nodes() through CSS. CSS is the way to tell rvest to point to a precise node in the webpage and this is brought by query. Thirdly it converts the content into readable text with html_text(). The entire process can be also thought as an autoencoder, where adding decoding layer after layer on top of the starting url, it can be reached the final requested payload data wanted. The reason why the process appear straightforward and simple relies in the blending with rvest by the pipe %&gt;% operator. Below it is shown a function that exemplifies scrapping the price. scrapeprice.imm = function(session) { opensess = read_html(session) price = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&quot;.im-mainFeatures__title&quot;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if(is.null(price) || identical(price, character(0))) { price2 = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&#39;.im-features__value , .im-features__title&#39;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if (&quot;prezzo&quot; %in% price2) { pos = match(&quot;prezzo&quot;,price2) return(price2[pos+1]) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } else { return(NA_character_) } } else { return(price) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } } The function takes as a single argument a session object which is initialized in one other function. Then It reads the inner html content in the session storing the information into an obj called the opensess. Another obj is created, namely price, right after the pipe operator a css query into the html is called. The css query .im-mainFeatures__title points to a precise data stored in immobiliare web page header, right below the main title. Expectation are that price is a one-element chr vector, containing the price and some other unnecessary characters. Then the algorithm enters into the first if statement. The handler checks if the object price is empty. If it doesnt the algorithm jumps to the end of the algorithm and returns the cleaned quantity. But If it does it takes again the opensess and redirect to a second css query .im-features__value , .im-features__title where price, once again in the webpage, could be found. Please note that This is all done within the same session, so no more request additional information has to be sent. Since the latter css query points to data stored inside a list, for the time being the newly created obj price2 is a list containing various information. Then the algorithm flow enters into the second if statement that checks whether the \"prezzo\" is matched the list or not, if it does it returns the +1 position index element with respect to the prezzo positioning. This happens because data in price2 list are stored by couples sequentially, e.g. [title, Appartamento Sempione, energy class, G, prezzo, 1200/al mese]. When it returns the element corresponding to +1 position index it applies also some data wrangling with stringr package to keep out overabundant characters. The function then escapes in the else statement by setting price2 = NA_Character_ once no css query could be finding the price information. the character-string type has to be imposed due to fact that later they can not be bind. In other words if the function is evaluated for a url and returns the price quantity, but then is evaluated for url2 and outputs NA (no character) then results can not be combined into dataframe due to different types. Once all the functions have been created they need to be called together and then data coming after them need to be combined. This is done by get,data.catsing() which at first checks the validity of the url, then takes the same url as input and filters it as a session object. Then simultaneously all the functions are called and then combined. All this happens inside a foreach parallel loop called by scrape.all.info() scrape.all.info = function(url = &quot;https://www.immobiliare.it/affitto-case...&quot;, vedi = FALSE, scrivi = FALSE, silent = FALSE){ if (silent) { start = as_hms(Sys.time()); cat(&#39;Starting the process...\\n\\n&#39;) message(&#39;\\nThe process has started in&#39;,format(start,usetz = TRUE)) } # open parallel multisession cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) #using max cores - 1 for parallel processing registerDoParallel(cl) start = as_hms(Sys.time()) if (silent) { message(&#39;\\n\\nStart all the requests at time:&#39;, format(start,usetz = T)) } ALL = foreach(i = seq_along(links), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .multicombine = FALSE, .export =&quot;links&quot; , .verbose = TRUE, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;utils.R&quot;) sourceEntireFolder(&quot;functions_singolourl&quot;) get.data.catsing = function(singolourl){ # dormi() # if(!is_url(singolourl)){ stop(paste0(&quot;The following url does not seem either to exist or it is invalid&quot;, singolourl)) } session = html_session(singolourl, user_agent(agents[sample(1)])) if (class(session) == &quot;session&quot;) { session = session$response } id = tryCatch({scrapehouse.ID(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapehouse.ID&quot;) }) lat = tryCatch({scrapelat.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelat.imm&quot;) }) long = tryCatch({scrapelong.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelong.imm&quot;) }) location = tryCatch({take.address(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in take.address&quot;) }) condom = tryCatch({scrapecondom.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapecondom.imm&quot;) }) buildage = tryCatch({scrapeagebuild.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapeagebuild.imm&quot;) }) ... combine = tibble(ID = id, LAT = lat, LONG = long, LOCATION = location, CONDOM = condom, BUILDAGE = buildage, ... return(combine) } stopCluster(cl) return(ALL) } The skeleton constitutes a standard format adopted for many other scraping function used in the analysis. Being equal the css query what it changes is the matching term, i.e. numero camere instead of prezzo to look for how many rooms there are in the house. This is true for all the information contained in the list accessed by the fixed css query. Those that are not they are a few and they do not need to be scraped. In addition some other functions outputs need to undergo to further heavy cleaning steps in order to be usable As a consequence oh that functions need also to be broken down by pieces into many single .R files whose names correspond to each important information. Below it is printed the tree structure folder that composes the main elements of the scraping procedure. It can be notices that the two folders, namely functions_singolourl and functions_url enclose all the single functions that allows to grab single information from session. Folders with a customized function are then sourced within the two main functions, scrape.all and scrape.all.info so data can be extracted. levelName 1 immobiliare.it-WebScraping 2 ¦--functions_singolourl 3 ¦ ¦--0scrapesqfeetINS.R 4 ¦ ¦--0scrapenroomINS.R 5 ¦ ¦--0scrapepriceINS.R 6 ¦ ¦--0scrapetitleINS.R 7 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAdDate.R 8 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAge.R 9 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAgeBuilding.R 10 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAirConditioning.R 11 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAptChar.R 12 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCatastInfo.R 13 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCompart.R 14 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCondom.R 15 ¦ ¦--ScrapeContr.R 16 ¦ ¦--ScrapeDisp.R 17 ¦ ¦--ScrapeEnClass.R 18 ¦ ¦--ScrapeFloor.R 19 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHasMulti.R 20 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHeating.R 21 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseID.R 22 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseTxtDes.R 23 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLAT.R 24 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLONG.R 25 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLoweredPrice.R 26 ¦ ¦--ScrapeMetrature.R 27 ¦ ¦--ScrapePhotosNum.R 28 ¦ ¦--ScrapePostAuto.R 29 ¦ ¦--ScrapePropType.R 30 ¦ ¦--ScrapeReaReview.R 31 ¦ ¦--ScrapeStatus.R 32 ¦ ¦--ScrapeTotPiani.R 33 ¦ ¦--ScrapeType.R 34 ¦ °--take_location.R 35 ¦--scrapeALL.R 36 ¦--scrapeALLINFO.R 37 ¦--functions_url 38 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHREF.R 39 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrice.R 40 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrimaryKey.R 41 ¦ ¦--ScrapeRooms.R 42 ¦ ¦--ScrapeSpace.R 43 ¦ °--ScrapeTitle.R 44 ¦--libs.R 45 ¦--utils.R 46 ¦--README.Rmd 47 ¦--README.md 48 °--simulations 49 ¦--rt_match_vs_forloop.R 50 °--runtime_simul.R 2.2 Scraping Best Practices and Robottxt Robots.txt files are (rivedi citation) a way to kindly ask webbots, spiders, crawlers, wanderers and the like to access or not access certain parts of a webpage. The de facto standard never made it beyond a informal Network Working Group INTERNET DRAFT. Nonetheless, the use of robots.txt files is widespread (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt, https://www.google.com/robots.txt) and bots from Google, Yahoo and the like will adhere to the rules defined in robots.txt files, although their interpretation of those rules might differ. Robots.txt files are plain text and always found at the root of a websites domain. The syntax of the files in essence follows a fieldname: value scheme with optional preceding user-agent:  lines to indicate the scope of the following rule block. Blocks are separated by blank lines and the omission of a user-agent field (which directly corresponds to the HTTP user-agent field) is seen as referring to all bots. # serves to comment lines and parts of lines. Everything after # until the end of line is regarded a comment. Possible field names are: user-agent, disallow, allow, crawl-delay, sitemap, and host. For further notions (Meissner and Ren 2020, @google:robottxt) Some interpretation problems: finding no robots.txt file at the server (e.g. HTTP status code 404) implies that everything is permitted subdomains should have there own robots.txt file if not it is assumed that everything is allowed redirects involving protocol changes - e.g. upgrading from http to https - are followed and considered no domain or subdomain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the - robots.txt file for the original domain redirects from subdomain www to the doamin is considered no domain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the robots.txt file for the subdomain originally requested For the thesis purposes it has been designed a dedicated function to inspect whether the domain requires specific actions or prevents some activity on thw target website. The following checkpermission() function has been integrated inside the scraping architecture and it is called once at the very beginning. library(robotstxt) dominio = &quot;immobiliare.it&quot; checkpermission = function(dom) { robot = robotstxt(domain = dom) vd = robot$check()[1] if (vd) { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt for&quot;, dom, &quot;is okay with scraping!&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt does not like what you&#39;re doing&quot;) ## stop() } } checkpermission(dominio) ## ## robot.txt for immobiliare.it is okay with scraping! Further improvements in this direction came from the polite package (Perepolkin 2019) which combines the power of the robotstxt, the ratelimitr to rate-limiting requests and the memoise for response caching. This package is wrapped up around 3 simple but effective ideas: The three pillars of a polite session are seeking permission, taking slowly and never asking twice. The three pillars constitute the Ethical web scraping manifesto (Densmore 2019) which are common shared practises that are aimed to self regularize scrapers. This has not nothing to do with law but since many scrapers themselves, as website administrators or analyst, have fought with bots. Bots might fake out real client logs and might stain analytics, so here it is born the choice to fine common ground and politely ask for permission. 2.3 User agents, Proxies, Handlers HTTP requests to the website server by web clients come with some mandatory information packed in it. The process according to which HTTP protocols allow to exchange information can be easily thought with an everyday real world analogy. As a generic person A rings the doors bell of person Bs house. A comes to B door with its personal information, its name, surname, where he lives etc. At this point B may either answer to A requests by opening the door and let him enter given the set of information he has, or it may not since B is not sure of the real intentions of A. This typical everyday situation in nothing more what happens billions of times on the internet everyday, the user (in the example above A) is interacting with a server website (part B) sending packets of information. If a server does not trust the information provided by the user, if the requests are too many, if the requests seems to be scheduled due to fixed sleeping time, a server can block requests. In certain cases it can even forbid the user log to the website. The language the two parties exchanges are coded in numbers that ranges from 100 to 511, each of which has its own specific significance. A popular case of this type of interaction occurs when users are not connected to internet so the server responds 404, page not found. Servers are built with a immune-system like software that raises barriers and block users to prevent dossing or other illegal practices. How Web Works This procedure is a day to day issue to people that are trying to collect information from websites. Google performs it everyday with its spider crawlers, which are very sophisticated bots that scrapes over a enormous range of websites. This challenge can be addressed in multiple ways, there are some specific Python packages that overcome this issue. The are also certain types of scraping as the Selenium web driver automation that simulates browser automation. Selenium allows the user not to be easily detected by the server immune system and peaceful. Precautions have not been taken lightly, and a simple but effective approach is proposed. 2.3.1 User agents Spoofing A user agent (WhoIsHostingThis.com 2020) is a string of characters in each web browser that serves as an identification agent. The user agent permits the web server to be able to identify the user operating system and the browser. Then, the web server uses the exchanged information to determine what content should be presented to particular operating systems and web browsers on a series of devices. The user agent string contains the user application or software, the operating system (and their versions), the web client, the web clients version, and the web engine responsible for the content display (such as AppleWebKit). The user agent string is sent in form of a HTTP request header. Since the User Agents acts as middle man between the client request and the server response what it would be better doing is to actively faking it so that each time a web browser presents himself to a web server it has a different specifications, different web client, different operating system and so on. The simple approach followed was building a vector of samples of different existing and updated User Agents (UA). Then whenever a request from a web browser is served to a web server 1 random sample string is drawn from the user agents deck. So each time the user is sending the requests it appears to have a different identity. Below the user agents rotating pool: set.seed(27) agents = c(&quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/602.2.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.1 Safari/602.2.14&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0&quot;) agents[sample(1)] ## [1] &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot; An improvement to this could be further using rotating proxies. A proxy server acts as a gateway between the web user and the web server. Its an intermediary server himself, separating end clients from the websites they are browsing. Proxy servers provide varying layers of functionality, security, and privacy are some of the examples. While the user is exploiting a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the server you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. Many proxy servers are offered in a paid version so in this case since security barriers of the target website are not high they will not be implemented. It has to be mentioned that many online services are providing free proxies but the turnaround of this solutions are many, two of them are: - Proxies to be free are widely shared among people, so as long as someone has used them for illegal purposes the user is inheriting their mistakes when caught. - Some of those proxies, pretty all the ones coming from low ranked websites, are tracked so there might be a user privacy violation issue. 2.3.2 Handlers During scraping many difficulties might be met. Starting from the things that have been previously explained at the chapter start. Some of them are: a varying url structure so that the html tree hierarchies are changed, payloads are not correctly parsed with respect to previous scraping sessions. ending with the ones that have just been said a few lines ago. Handlers and trycatch error workarounds are explicitly built in this sense. The continuous testing of the scraping functioning while developing has required the maintainer to track where the error occurs. A few numbers: the agglomerative function get.data.catsing() triggers more than 36 scrapping functions that are going to catch 36 different data pieces. If one of them went missing then the other one would be missing too. Then when row-data is binded together one entry column might not exists making the process fail. Then the solution to that is to call inside the aggolmerative function as much as trycatch as many scrapping functions are involved. The trycatch can leverage the gap by introducing a specified quantity and alerting that something went wrong. On top of that many other handlers are called throughout the procedure: get_ua() verifies that the user agent coming from the session request is not the default one get_ua = function(sess) { stopifnot(is.session(sess)) stopifnot(is_url(sess$url)) ua = sess$response$request$options$useragent return(ua) } is_url() verifies that the url input needed has the canonic form. This is done by a REGEX query. is_url = function(url) { re = &quot;^(?:(?:http(?:s)?|ftp)://)(?:\\\\S+(?::(?:\\\\S)*)?@)?(?:(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)*(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;]){2,})(?::(?:\\\\d){2,5})?(?:/(?:\\\\S)*)?$&quot; grepl(re, url) } .get_delay() checks through the robotxt file if a delay between each request is kindly welcomed. .get_delay = function(domain) { message(sprintf(&quot;Refreshing robots.txt data for %s...&quot;, domain)) cd_tmp = robotstxt::robotstxt(domain)$crawl_delay if (length(cd_tmp) &gt; 0) { star = dplyr::filter(cd_tmp, useragent==&quot;*&quot;) if (nrow(star) == 0) star = cd_tmp[1,] as.numeric(star$value[1]) } else { 10L } } get_delay = memoise::memoise(.get_delay) 2.3.3 Parallel Computing Since are opened as many sessions as single links and since for each link are going to be called many functions computations can take a while. Reporting it into numbers in order to get a usable dataset 300 pages are considered, which at their own time contains 25 links per page, for which almost 34 different functions are called. For the sake of the analysis and the app this should not bother the end user because scraping tasks are performed daily by a scheduler and a single day is sufficient amount of runtime. In any case functions are optimized following optimization criteria. Run time is crucial when dealing with active web pages and time to market in real estate is very important, here comes the need to have always fresh data. A way to secure fresh new data is to have lightweight computation on a single machine o heavy computation spread among a pool of different machines, in this case multi-threaded sessions. All the following runtime examinations are performed on the scrape functions a lightweight version of the final scraping API function. A first attempt was using furrr package (Vaughan and Dancho 2018) which enables mapping through a list with the purrr, along with a future parallel backend. The approach has shows decent results, but its run time drastically increases when more requests are sent. This leads to a preventive conclusion about the computational complexity: it has to be at least linear. Empirical demonstrations have been made: library(furrr) vecelaps = c() start = c() end = c() for (i in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start[i] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;, i, &quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) list.of.pages.imm[1:i] %&gt;% furrr::future_map(get.data.caturl, .progress = T) %&gt;% bind_rows() end[i] = Sys.time() vecelaps[i] = end[i] - start[i] } furrrmethod = tibble(start, end, vettoelaps) # ggplot (themed) run time meausurament method 1 p = ggplot(furrrmethod,aes(x=1:20, y=vettoelaps)) + geom_line( color=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Num URLS evaluated&quot;) + ylab(&quot;run time (in seconds)&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Run-Time for First method (furrr multisession)&quot;) + stat_smooth(method=lm) + theme_nicco() p computational complexity analysis with Furrr On the x-axis the number of urls which are evaluated together, on y axis the run time taken measured in seconds. Iteration after iteration the urls considered are increased by a unity. Looking at the smooth curve in between confidence lines a first guess might be linear time \\(\\mathbf{O}(n)\\), where n are the links considered. A second attempt tried to explore the foreach package (Microsoft and Weston 2020). This interesting package enables a new looping construct for executing R code in an iterative way. The main reason for using the foreach package is that it supports parallel execution, that is, it can execute those repeated operations on multiple processors/cores on the computer, or on multiple nodes of a cluster. The construction is straightforward: start clusters on processors cores define the iterator, in this case i = to the elements that are going to be looped through .packages: Inherits the packages that are used in the tasks define below .combine: Define the combining function that bind results at the end (say cbind, rbind or tidyverse::bind_rows). It has to be a string. .errorhandling: specifies how a task evaluation error should be handle. %dopar%: the dopar keyword suggests foreach with parallelization method then the function within the elements are iterated close clusters One major important thing concerns the fact that th function within iterators repeats itself should be standalone. For standalone it is meant that the body function should be defined inside, as it would be a an empty environment. As a matter of fact packages has to be taken inside each time, and if the function is not defined inside body (or is not source from some other locations) the clusters can not operate and an error is printed. cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) registerDoParallel(cl) vettoelaps1 = c() start1 = c() end1 = c() for (j in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start1[j] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;,j,&quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) foreach(i = seq_along(list.of.pages.imm[1:j]), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;main.R&quot;) x = get.data.caturl(list.of.pages.imm[i]) } end1[j] = Sys.time() vettoelaps1[j] = end1[j] -start1[j] } stopCluster(cl) computational complexity analysis with Furrr It can be seen quite easily that the curve now is flattened and first guess is logarithmic time \\(\\mathbf{O}(log(n))\\). A further improvement could be obtained using a new package called doAzureParallel which is built on top of foreach. doAzureParallel enables different Virtual Machines operates parallel computing throughout Microsoft Azure cloud, but this comes at a substantial monetary cost. This would be a perfect match given that parallel methods seen before accelerates the number of requests sent among different processors or cluster, even though actually what it is really needed it is something that separates session. Unleashing Virtual Machines permits from one hand to further increase computational power and the number of potential requests, from the other it can splits requests among different user agents (a pool for each VM) masquerading even better the scraping automation. 2.4 Further Improvements The main challenge remains unsolved since each single elements has been finely optimized but API continues to be unstable. What it can not be optimized are the system ad choices to change the layout of the page or to change the url structure (allocation of datain the web page). The way the API is designed really facilitates responsive fast debugging but this can not be by any means automatized. The API necessitates frequently to resort to continuous integration (i.e. CI) review to verify the working status. Moreover Error messages can not really be undestood sometimes, this is due to functions that are called within a parallel beckend that does not allow [refererenza su stack overflow di errore di print] to print error on console. So each time an error occur the main functions needs to be taken out of from the foreach cluster and evaluated in isolation where the loop stops. This is trivial and time consuming but for the time being no solutions have been provided. 2.5 Legal Challenges (ancora non validato) Data that are online and public are always available for all is never a good answer to the question Can I use those web data to my scope. Immobiliare.it is not providing any open source data from its own database neither it is planning to do so in the future. It has not even provided a paid API through which might be possible to perform analysis. A careful reading of their terms has been done to get this service running without any legal consequence, as a reference further information can be collected in their specialized section. Nevertheless the golden standard for scraping was respected since the robottxt file talks clearly permitting any action as demonstrated above. So if it might be the case of misuse of their intellectual their property, it will be also the case of misunderstanding between servers response and immobiliare.it intent to preserve their own intellectual property. What it has been really surprising are the low barriers to request information to their severs with respect to other online players. Best practices are applied and delayed requests have been sent to normalized traffic congestion in compliance to anti-dossing rules. But scraping criteria followed are fully based on common shared best practises (see section 2.2), and not any sort of agreements between parties (i.e. general terms and agreements). As a result a possible approach could be applying scraping procedures without any prevention. It would not surely cause any sort of disservice for the website but in the long run when scrapers are few, but in the long run it will cause delays as soon as subjects will increase. Totally different was the approach proposed by Idealista.com, which is a comparable to immobiliare.it. Idealista does block requests if they are not in compliance with their servers predefined ones. User agents in this case must be rotated quite frequently and as soon as a request does not fall within the pool of user agents (i.e. is labled as web bot) it is immediately blocked and 404 response is sent back. Idealista content is composed by Javascript so and html parser can no get that. Idealista blocks also certain web browser that have a demonstrated career in scraping procedures. All of this leads to accept that entry barriers to scrape are for sure higher than the one faced for Immobiliare. The reticence to share data could be a reflex on how big idealista is; as a matter of fact it has a heavy market presence in some of the Europe real estates country as Spain and France. So what they thought was to raise awareness on scraping procedure that in a certain way can hurt their business. This has been validated by the fact that prior filtering houses on their website a checkbox has to be signed. The checkbox make the user sign an agreement on their platform according to which data can not be misused and it belongs their intellectual property.

Challenges in scraping as pointed out in section 2.4 are many and still some remains unsolved. Challenges regards not only scraping but also the way the service has to respond to the users. Service has to be fast otherwise data become obsolete and so happen to analysis that relied on those data. Service has to be deployed so that in does not only run locally. Service needs to be scaled when needed since when the number of users increases the run time performance should not decrease. Service has to be maintained up to date so that each function can be reshaped with respect to immobiliare.it layout changes. On the other hand code behind the service has to be kept freezed to certain version, so that when packages are updated service still runs. Furthemore service has to be also secured granting access only to the ones authorized. In the end Service has to be run at a certain given times and storing data on cloud, so that it can be tracked back the evolution of the phenomenon. Open source solutions are available for back-end and front-end to meet the requirements before. Documentations related to technologies served are up to date and offer flexible solutions to embed the R environment. As a general discussion technologies used can be thought as the distance between something running locally on the laptop and something that is actually put into production, seen by company stakeholders, solving business problem. When such technologies are applied data scientist and counterparts gradually close the gap. Insights are better communicated (they can be interactive or automated) and services can be shared over a wider range of subjects. Nonetheless when the infrastructure is made with vision then integrating or substituting existing technologies is not trivial. Anyway technologies can not be always embedded because they might be exclusively designed to work only on certain back ends, therefore some choices are not into discussion. With foresight RStudio by setting future-oriented guidelines has spent a lot of effort giving its users an easy, integrated and interconnected environment. By that it is meant that the RStudio community has tried to either integrate or open the possibility to a number of technologies that fill the blanks in their weaker parts. On top of many, an entire package has been dedicated to democratize REST APIs (Plumber (Trestle Technology, LLC 2018)). As a further example developers in RStudio have created an entire new paradigm i.e. Shiny (Chang et al. 2020), a popular web app development package, that enforces the developer to have front-end and back-end technologies tied up in the same IDE. They also added performance monitoring and optimization packages that are fitted into shiny such as shinytest [metti tag] and shinyloadtest [metti tag] to simulate sessions and verify network traffic congestion. The actual idea is to provide a REST API with 4 endpoints which calls parallelized scraping functions. On the other hand (chapter 2) a daily scheduler, exposing one API endpoint, produces and later stores a .csv file in a NOSQL mongoDB Atlas could database. It is all meant to be containerized in a Linux env (Ubuntu distr) docker container hosted by a AWS EC2 server. API endpoints are going to be secured with https protocols and protected with authentication by nginx reverse proxy. A Shiny app calls an endpoint with specified parameters which returns up to date data from the former infrastructure. It then models data with bayesian spatial methods 6. Technologies involved are: GitHub version control Scheduler cron job, section 3.1 Docker containers, section 3.2 Plumber REST API, section 3.3.1 NGINX reverse proxy, section 3.4 AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 3.5 MongoDB Atlas Shiny, see chapter 8 complete infrastructure (Matt Dancho source) As a side note even each single part of this thesis has been made stand alone and can be easily accessed and modified through a gitbook deployed at @link. RMarkdown knits the .rmd files extension and coverts them into .html files (the books chapters). All the documents are then pushed to a Github repository with git. By a simple trick, since all the files are static html, they can be displayed through GH pages as it is a website whose link is a github subdomain. The pdf output for the thesis can be obtained by clicking the download button, then choosing output pdf in the upper banner. A Latex engine (Xelatex) wrapped into the website compiles the sequence of RMarkdown documents according to a predefined .tex template. Formatting can be tuned by modifying the .yml file, that sets general instructions for the pdf document. All of this has been possible thanks to Bookdown (Xie 2020) once again a R well documented package (Xie 2016) to build interactive books along with RMarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020). Some of the main technologies implied will be viewed singularly, nonetheless for brevity some of them will be skipped. 3.1 Scheduler A Scheduler in a process is a component on a OS that allows the computer to decide which activity is going to be executed. In the context of multi-programming it is thought as a tool to keep CPU occupied as much as possible. As an example it can trigger a process while some other is still waiting to finish. There are many type of scheduler and they are based on the frequency of times they are executed considering a certain closed time neighbor. Short term scheduler: it can trigger and queue the ready to go tasks with pre-emption without pre-emption The ST scheduler selects the process and It gains control of the CPU by the dispatcher. In this context we can define latency as the time needed to stop a process and to start a new one. Medium term scheduler Long term scheduler for some other useful but beyond the scope refereces, such as the scheduling algorithm the reader can refer to (Wikiversità 2020). 3.1.1 Cron Jobs Cron job is a software utility which acts as a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like OS. Linux users that set up and maintain software environments exploit cron to schedule their day-to-day routines to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance but its usage is very flexible to whichever needed. It is lightweight and it is widely used since it is a common option for Linux users. The tasks by cron are driven by a crontab file, which is a configuration file that specifies a set of commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and has this structure crontab Each line of a crontab file represents a job. This example runs a shell named scheduler.sh at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday. .sh commands can update mails and other minor routines. 45 23 * * 6 /home/oracle/scripts/scheduler.sh Some rather unusual scheduling definitions for crontabs can be found in this reference (Wikipedia contributors 2020). Crontabs syntax completion can be made easier through this GUI. The cron job needs to be ran on scraping fucntions at 11:30 PM every single day. The get_data.R script first sources an endpoint function, then it applies the function with fixed parameters. Parameters describe the url specification, so that each time the scheduler runs the get_data.R collects data from the same source. Day after day .json files are generated and then stored into a NOSQL mongoDB database whose credentials are public. Data are collected on a daily basis with the explicit aim to track day-by-day changes both in the new entries an goners in rental market, and to investigate the evolution of price differentials over time. Spatio-Temporal modeling is still quite unexplored, data is saved for future used. Crontab configuration for daily 11:30 PM schedules has this appearance: 30 11 * * * /home/oracle/scripts/get_data.R Since now the computational power comes from the machine on which the system is installed. A smarter solution takes care of it by considering run time limits and the substantial inability to share data. To a certain extent what it has been already done since now might fit for personal use: a scheduler can daily execute the scraping scripts and generate a .csv file. Furthermore an application can rely on those data, but evident reasons suggest that it does not suite any need. What it will do the trick would be an open source dedicated software environment or container that will contains scraping functions and a scheduler on cloud solving a pair of the problems arisen. This problem can be addressed with a technology that has seen a huge growth in its usage in the last few years. 3.2 Docker 3.2.1 What is Docker Docker is a software tool to create and deploy applications using containers. Docker containers are a standard unit of software (i.e. software boxes) where everything needed for applications, such as libraries or dependencies can be run reliably and quickly. Furthermore they are also portable, in the sense that they can be taken from one computing environment to the following. Docker containers by default run on kernel Linux OS. Containers can be thought as an abstraction at the app layers that groups code and dependencies together. One major advantage of containers is that multiple containers can run on the same machine with the same OS. Each container can run its own isolated process in the user space, so that each task is complementary to the other. Containers are lightweight and take up less space than Virtual Machines (container images are files which can take up typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer Virtual Machines and OSs. docker container vs VM When containers are built Docker container Images are created and can be open sourced with Docker Hub Docker Hub is a web service provided by Docker for searching and sharing container images with other teams or developers in the community. Docker Hub behind authentication allows to integrate GitHub in the Docker project repository. Once the connection is authorized on local machine changes are made and then pushed by version control to the remote GH repository. The push command triggers the automatic building (pre-set by the user, branch should be given) of the image in the docker hub repository. The just created docker image can be tagged so that firstly it is recognizable and secondly can be reused in the future. Once the building stage is completed the DH repository can be pulled and then run locally on machine or cloud, see section 3.5. Docker building and testing images can be very time consumin. R packages can take a long time to install because code has to be compiled, especially if using R on a Linux server or in a Docker container. Rstudio package manager includes beta support for pre-compiled R packages that can be installed faster. This dramatically reduces packages time installation (Nolis 2020). In addition an open source project named rocker have already narrowed the path building custom R images for R and docker users. What can be read from their own website about them: The rocker project provides a collection of containers suited for different needs. find a base image to extend or images with popular software and optimized libraries pre-installed. Get the latest version or a reproducible fixed environment. Enabling caching when container images are built heavily shorten the total duration for containerization. 3.2.2 Why Docker Indeed, an employment-related search engine, released an article on 2019 displaying changing trends from 2015 to 2019 in Technology Job market. Many changes are relevant in key technologies. Two among the others technologies (i.e. docker and Azure) have experienced a huge growth and both refer to the same demand input: containers . The landscape of Data Science is changing (Economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab 2020) from reporting to application building: In 2015 - Businesses reports drive better decisions In 2020 - Businesses need apps to empower better decision making at all levels docker-stats For all the things said what docker is bringing to business (R. H. Inc. 2020): Speed application deployment : containers include the minimal run time requirements of the application, reducing their size and allowing them to be deployed quickly. Portability across machines : an application and all its dependencies can be bundled into a single container that is independent from the host version of Linux kernel, platform distribution, or deployment model. This container can be transfered to another machine that runs Docker, and executed there without compatibility issues. Version control and component reuse : you can track successive versions of a container, inspect differences, or roll-back to previous versions. Containers reuse components from the preceding layers, which makes them noticeably lightweight. In addition due to Docker Hub it is possible to establish a connection between Git and DockerHub. Vesion Sharing : you can use a remote repository to share your container with others. It is also possible to configure a private repository hosted on Docker Hub. Lightweight footprint and minimal overhead : Docker images are typically very small, which facilitates rapid delivery and reduces the time to deploy new application containers. Fault isolation :Docker reduces effort and risk of problems with application dependencies. Docker also freezes the environment to the preferred packages version so that it guarantees continuity in deployment and isolate the container from system fails coming from package version updates. The way to tell docker which system requirements are needed in the newly born software is a Dockerfile. 3.2.3 Dockerfile Docker can build images automatically by reading instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands/rules a generic user could call on the CLI to assemble an image. Executing the command docker build from shell the user can trigger the image building. That executes sequentially several command-line instructions. For thesis purposes a dockerfile is written with the specific instructions and then the file is pushed to GitHub repository. Once pushed DockerHub automatically parses the repository looking for a plain text file whose name is Dockerfile. When It is matched then it trriggers the building of the image. The Dockerfile used to trigger the building of the service docker container has the following set of instructions: dockerfile FROM rocker/tidyverse:latest : the command imports a pre-built image by the rocker team that contains the latest (tag latest) version of base-R along with the tidyverse packages. MAINTAINER Niccolo Salvini \"niccolo.salvini27@gmail.com\" : The command tags the maintainer and its e-mail contact information. RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\ libxml2-dev \\ libudunits2-dev :The command update and install Linux dependencies needed for running R packages. rvest requires libxml2-dev and magrittr needs libudunits2-dev. If they are not installed then associated libraries can not be loaded. Linux dependencies needed have been found by trial and error while building containers. Building logs messages print errors and suggest which dependency is mandatory. RUN R -e \"install.packages(c('plumber','tibble','...',dependencies=TRUE) : the command install all the packages required to execute the files (R files) containerized for the scraping. Since all the packages have their direct R dependencies the option dependencies=TRUE is needed. RUN R -e \"install.packages('https://cran.r-project.org/.../iterators, type='source') RUN R -e \"install.packages('https://cran.r-project.org/.../foreach/, type='source') RUN R -e \"install.packages('https://cran.r-project.org/.../doParallel, type='source') DoParallel was not available in package manager for R version later than 4.0.0. For this reason the choice was to install a previous source version by the online repository, as well as its dependencies. COPY \\\\ The command tells Docker copies all the files in the container. EXPOSE 8000 : the commands instructs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports 8000 at runtime. It is possible to specify whether the port exposed listens on UDP or TCP, the default is TCP (this part needs a previous set up previous installing, for further online documentation It is recommended (D. Inc. 2020) ) ENTRYPOINT [\"Rscript\", \"main.R\"] : the command tells docker to execute the file main.R within the container that triggers the API start. In main.R it are pecified both the port and the host where API expects to be exposed (in this case port 8000). In order to make the system stand-alone and make the service available to a wider range of subjects a choice has to be made. The service has to have both the characteristics to be run on demand and to specify query parameters. 3.3 REST API (approfondisci REST) API stands for application programming interface and it is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. APIs let a product or a service communicate with other products and services without having to know how theyre implemented. This can simplify app development, saving time and impacting positively on the budget. APIs are sometimes thought of as contracts, with documentation that represents an agreement between parties. There are many types of API that exploit different medium to communicate with apps or services. HTTP API are a special type of API that accepts http requests as input and elaborate them through end points. An end point identifies the operation through traditional http methods (e.g. /GET /POST) that the API caller wants to perform. HTTP APIs have now become the predominant medium by which software exchanges information, further documentation and differences between REST and RESTful API can be found here. API examples: - Google Maps API: allows developers to embed geo-location data using JavaScript. The Google Maps API is designed to work on mobile and desktop. - YouTube API: allows developers integrate YouTube videos and functionalities into websites or applications. - Google Analytics API: allows to track website performance in terms of audience, monetization and other important metrics through the Google Analytics interface. The website the thesis come from has this implementation working. This is obtained by embedding the existing R source code into the Plumber API framework. API functioning 3.3.1 Plumber API Plumber (An Api Generator for R 2020) allows the user to create a web API by simply adding decoration comments to the existing R source code. Decorations are a special type of comments that suggests to plumber where and when the API parts are. Below the original API source code. # plumber.R # * Echo back the input * @param msg The message to echo * @get /echo function(msg = &quot;&quot;) { list(msg = paste0(&quot;The message is: &#39;&quot;, msg, &quot;&#39;&quot;)) } # * Plot a histogram * @serializer png * @get /plot function() { rand &lt;- rnorm(100) hist(rand) } # * Return the sum of two numbers * @param a The first number to add * @param b # The second number to add * @post /sum function(a, b) { as.numeric(a) + as.numeric(b) } three endpoints associated to 2 /GET and 1 /POST requests are made available. Functions are made clear without names so that whenever the endpoint is called functions are directly executed. Decorations are marked as this #* and they are followed by specific keywords denoted with @. - the @params keyword refers to parameter that specifies the corpus of the HTTP request, i.e. the inputs with respect to the expected output. If default parameters are inputted then the API response is the elaboration of the functions with default parameters. As opposite endpoint function elaborates the provided parameters and returns a response. - #* @serializer specifies the extension of the output file when needed. - #* @get specifies the method of HTTP request sent. - /echo is the end point name. - @filter decorations activates a filter layer which are used to track logs and to parse request before passing the argbody to the end points. - many more 3.3.2 Immobiliare.it REST API The API service is composed by three endpoints /scrape , /links and /complete: */scrape performs a fast scraping that extracts 5 covariates directly from filtered url. url from which data extraction takes place might be composed through parameters. By default the end point scrape data from Milan real estate rental market. Fast scraping is reached thanks to avoiding to access to single links. It is a superficial scraping and does not contain geospatial, however it might fit for regression settings. */links: extracts the list of single links belonging to each of the page, looking at section 2.1.1 each 25 single links for each sibling. It displays sufficient performances in terms of run time. It is propaedeutic to apply the following endpoint. */complete: both the function all.links and complete are sourced. The former with the aim to grab each single links and store it into an object. The latter to actually iterate scraping on each of the links. swagger 3.3.3 REST API source code Get FAST data, it covers 5 covariates: title, price, num of rooms, sqmeter, primarykey # * Get all the links * @param city [chr string] the city you are interested to # extract data (lowercase without accent) * @param npages [positive integer] # number of pages to scrape default = 10, min = 2, max = 300 * @param type [chr # string] affitto = rents, vendita = sell (vendita no available for now) * @get # /links/&lt;npages:int&gt;/&lt;city:chr&gt;/&lt;type:chr&gt;/&lt;.thesis:bool&gt; function(npages = 10, city = &quot;milano&quot;, type = &quot;affitto&quot;, .thesis = F, req) { cat(&quot;\\n\\n port:&quot;, req$SERVER_PORT, &quot;\\n server_name:&quot;, req$SERVER_NAME, &quot;\\n\\n&quot;) if (npages &gt; 300 &amp; npages &gt; 0) { stop(&quot;npages must be between 1 and 1,000&quot;) } if (.thesis) { list(all.links(npages, city, type, .thesis = TRUE)) } else { list(all.links(npages, city, type)) } } # * Get the complete data from single links (not the raw) * @param city [chr # string] the city you are interested to extract data (lowercase without accent) # * @param npages [positive integer] number of pages to scrape default = 10, min # = 2, max = 300 * @param type [chr string] affitto = rents, vendita = sell # (vendita no available for now) * @get # /complete/&lt;npages:int&gt;/&lt;city:chr&gt;/&lt;type:chr&gt;/&lt;.thesis:bool&gt; function(npages = 10, city = &quot;milano&quot;, type = &quot;affitto&quot;, .thesis = F, req) { if (npages &gt; 300 &amp; npages &gt; 0) { stop(&quot;npages must be between 1 and 1,000&quot;) } if (.thesis) { links = all.links(npages, city, type, .thesis = TRUE) list(complete(links)) } else { links = all.links(npages, city, type) list(complete(links)) } } 3.3.4 REST API documentation Get FAST data, it covers 5 covariates: title, price, num of rooms, sqmeter, primarykey GET */scrape @param city [chr string] the city you are interested in (e.g. &quot;roma&quot;, &quot;milano&quot;, &quot;firenze&quot;--&gt; lowercase, without accent) @param npages [positive integer] number of pages to scrape, default = 10, min = 2, max = 300 @param type [chr string] &quot;affitto&quot; = rents, &quot;vendita&quot; = sell @param macrozone [chr string] avail: Roma, Firenze, Milano, Torino; e.g. &quot;fiera&quot;, &quot;centro&quot;, &quot;bellariva&quot;, &quot;parioli&quot; content-type: application/json Get all the links GET */link @param city [chr string] the city you are interested to extract data (lowercase without accent) @param npages [positive integer] number of pages to scrape default = 10, min = 2, max = 300 @param type [chr string] &quot;affitto&quot; = rents, &quot;vendita&quot; = sell @param .thesis [logical] data used for master thesis content-type: application/json Get the complete set of covariates (52) from each single links, takes a while GET */complete @param city [chr string] the city you are interested to extract data (lowercase without accent) @param npages [positive integer] number of pages to scrape default = 10, min = 2, max = 300 @param type [chr string] &quot;affitto&quot; = rents, &quot;vendita&quot; = sell @param .thesis [logical] data used for master thesis content-type: application/json 3.4 NGINX reverse proxy server For analysis purposes NGINX is open source software for reverse proxying and load balancing. Proxying is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, seamlessly show content from different websites, or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP. [] When NGINX proxies a request, it sends the request to a specified proxied server, fetches the response, and sends it back to the client. It is possible to proxy requests to an HTTP server (another NGINX server or any other server) or a non-HTTP server (which can run an application developed with a specific framework, such as PHP or Python) using a specified protocol. Supported protocols include FastCGI, uwsgi, SCGI, and memcached. [] .conf file and installation on Linux server. Security and Authentication. 3.5 AWS EC2 server Executing REST API on a public server allows to share data with a various number of services thorugh multitude of subjects. Since it can not be specified a-priori how many times and users are going to enjoy the service a scalable solutio might fill the needs. Scalable infrastructure through a flexible cloud provider combined with nginx load balancing can offer a stable and reliable infrastructure for a relatively cheap price. AWS offers a wide range of services each of which for a wide range of budgets and integration. Free tier servers can be rent up to a certain amount of storage and computation that nearly 0s the total bill. The cloud provider also has a dedicated webpage to configure the service needed with respect to the usage named amazon cost manager. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that contributes to a secure, flexible computing capacity in the AWS cloud. EC2 allows to rent as many virtual servers as needed with customized capacity, security and storage. [few words still on EC2] 3.5.1 Launch an EC2 instance The preliminary step is to pick up an AMI (Amazon Machine Image). AWS AMI are already-set-up machines with stadardized specification designed to speed up the process of choosing the a customed machine. Since the project is planned to be nearly 0-cost a Free Tier Eligible server is chosen. By checking the Free Tier box all the available free tiers are displayed. The machine selected has this specification: t2.micro with 1 CPU and 1GB RAM and runs on a Ubuntu distribution OS. First set up settings needs to be left as-is, networking and VPC can always be updated when needed. In the add storage step 30 GB storage are selected, moreover 30 represent the upper limit since the server can be considered free tier. Tags windows are beyond the scope. Secondly configuration needs to account security and a new entry below SSH connection (port 22) has to be set in. New security configuration has to have TCP specification and should be associated to port 8000. Port 8000, as in dockerfile section 3.2.3, has been exposed and needs to be linked to the security port opened. aws_dashboard At this point instance is prepared to run and in a few minutes is deployed. Key pairs, if never done before, are generated and .pem file is saved and securely stored. Key pairs are mandatory to access to the Ubuntu server via SSH. SSH connection in Windows OS can be handled with PuTTY, which is a SSH and telnet client designed for Windows. At first PuTTYgen has to convert the key pair .pem file into a .ppk extension (otherwise Putty can not read it). Once converted .ppk is sourced in the authorization panel. If everything works and authentication is verified then the Ubuntu server CLI appears and an interaction with the server is made available. posso far vedere: - come si fa deplyment su AWS quindi - inizializzazione istanza - settare paramtri - mettere spazio macchina - spiegare perchè conviene tenere un server AWS References "],["exploratory.html", "Chapter 4 Exploratory Analysis 4.1 What data is 4.2 Data Glimpse 4.3 Explorative Analysis", " Chapter 4 Exploratory Analysis 4.1 What data is Data come packed from the API end point /complete in JSON format.

INLA does approximate bayesian inference on special type of models called LGM (Latent Gaussian Models) due to the fact that they are computationally convenient. The benefits are many, some among the other are: Low computational costs, even for large models. It provides high accuracy. Can define very complex models within that framework. Most important statistical models are LGM. Very good support for spatial models. Implementation of spatio-temporal model enabled. INLA uses a combination of analytics approximations and numerical integration to obtain an approximated posterior distribution of the parameters in a shorter time period. The chronologic steps in the methodology presentation follows the course sailed by Moraga (2019) blended with the author choice to skip details. As a matter of fact the aim of the chapter is to provide a comprehensive intuition oriented to the immediate application of the methodology, without stepping too long on mathematical details. By the way details e.g model assessment and control options are handled under the hood by the package and can be tuned within the main function, most of them are covered by Gómez Rubio (2020). Notation is imported from Marta Blangiardo (2015) and Gómez Rubio (2020), and quite differ from the one presented in the original paper by Rue, Chopin and Martino (2009). As further notation remarks: bold symbols are considered as vectors, so each time they occur they have to be considered like the ensamble of their values. In addition \\(\\tilde\\pi\\) in section 5.2 are the Laplace approximation of the underlying integrals. Moreover the inner functioning of Laplace approximation and its special usage within the INLA setting is far from the scope, but an easy shortcut oriented to INLA is in Marta Blangiardo (2015). INLA can fit only Latent Gaussian type of models and the following work tries to encapsulate its properties. Then afterwards a problem can be reshaped into the LGM framework with the explicit purpose to explore its benefits. When models are reduced to LGMs then joint posterior distribution can be rewritten and then approximated with INLA. A hierarchical bayesian structure on the model will help to integrate many parameter and hyperparameter levels and simplify interpretation. Generic Information on the project and the R-INLA package are contained in the introduction to last section 5.3. In the end a brief application on a toy spatial dataset is proposed with the aim to fasten the familiarity with the methodology and to come to grip with INLA results. 5.1 Latent Gaussian Models LGM Given some observations \\(y_{i \\ldots n}\\) in order to define a Latent Gaussain Model within the bayesian framework it is convenient to specify at first an exponential family (Gaussian, Poisson, Exponential) distribution function characterized by some parameters \\(\\phi_{i}\\) (usually expressed by the mean \\(\\left.E\\left(y_{i}\\right)\\right)\\)) and some other hyper-parameters \\(\\psi_{k} ,\\forall k \\in \\ 1\\ldots K\\). The parameter \\(\\phi_{i}\\) can be defined as an additive latent linear predictor \\(\\eta_{i}\\), as pointed out by Krainski and Rubio ((2019)) through a link function \\(g(\\cdot)\\), i.e. \\(g\\left(\\phi_{i}\\right)=\\eta_{i}\\). A comprehensive expression of the linear predictor takes into account all the possible effects on covariates \\[ \\eta_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\beta_{m} x_{m i}+\\sum_{l=1}^{L} f_{l}\\left(z_{l i}\\right) \\] where \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\left\\{\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{M}\\right\\}\\) are the coefficient that quantifies the linear effects on covariates \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left({x}_{1}, \\ldots, {x}_{M}\\right)\\) and \\(f_{l}(\\cdot), \\forall l \\in 1 \\ldots L\\) are a set of random effects defined in terms of a \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\) set of covariates \\(\\boldsymbol{z}=\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{L}\\right)\\) (e.g. rw, ar1). As a consequence of the last assumption LGM models can receive a wide range of models e.g. GLM, GAM, GLMM, linear models and spatio-temporal models. This constitutes one of the main advantages of INLA, which can fit many models, starting from simpler and ending with more complex. Contributors recently are extending the methodology to many areas and are trying to incorporate non gaussian latent models as Rubio (2020) pointed out. All the latent components can be conveniently grouped into a variable denoted with \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) such that: \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\left\\{\\beta_{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, f\\right\\}\\) and the same can de done for hyper parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} = \\left\\{\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{K}\\right\\}\\). Then the probability distribution conditioned to parameters and hyper parameters is then: \\[ y_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\sim \\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta},\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right) \\] Since data \\(\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)\\) is drawn by the same distribution family but it is conditioned to parameters and hyper parameters (i.e. conditional independence) then joint distribution is given by the likelihood. Moreover the Product operator index \\(i\\) ranges from 1 to \\(n\\), i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I} = \\left\\{1 \\ldots n \\right\\}\\). When an observation is missing so the corresponding \\(i \\notin \\mathbf{I}\\) INLA automatically will not include it in the model avoiding errors (2020). As a consequence the likelihood expression is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi})=\\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{I}} \\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right) \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] Each data point is connected to a linear combination of each element in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) said latent field. The latent aspect of the field regards the undergoing existence of many parameter combination alternatives. Each component of the latent field is supposed to be conditionally independent (i.e. \\(\\pi\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{j} \\mid \\theta_{-i, j}\\right)=\\pi\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{-i, j}\\right) \\pi\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid \\theta_{-i, j}\\right)\\)) which constitutes a very important assumption. Furthermore hyper parameters are by definition independent, in other words \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) will be the product of many univariate priors (Gómez Rubio 2020). A Multivariate Normal distribution is imposed on the latent field \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) such that it is centered in 0 with precision matrix (the inverse of the variance amtrix) \\(\\boldsymbol{Q(\\psi)}\\) depending only on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) hyper parameter vector i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{Q}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\\right)\\). As side note some authors choose to approach the precision matrix as a covariance function in the setting before. This is strongly not encouraged since it complicates notation. However This has to be forcibly done in next chapter 6.1.1 since a special covariance function, i.e. Matérn, is used. The exponential family density function is then expressed through: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi})=(2 \\pi)^{-n / 2}| \\boldsymbol{Q(\\psi)}|^{1 / 2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\boldsymbol{Q(\\psi)} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right) \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] The conditional independence assumption on the latent field \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) leads \\(\\boldsymbol{Q(\\psi)}\\) to be a sparse precision matrix, and the probability distribution function can be framed as Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). From here it comes the source of run time computation saving, inherited using GMRF for inference. As a consequence of GMRF representation of the latent field, matrices are sparse so numerical methods can be exploited (Marta Blangiardo 2015). Moreover when special stochastic process (e.g. Gaussian Process6.1) are driven as GMRF through SPDE equations results (Stochastic Partial Differential Equations) INLA can be applied. This last assumption will be discussed and verified in dedicated chapter 7. Once priors are specified for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) then the following holds: \\[ \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid y)\\propto \\underbrace{\\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})}_{\\text {prior }} \\times \\underbrace{\\pi(\\theta \\mid \\psi)}_{\\text {GMRF }} \\times \\underbrace{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right)}_{\\text {likelihood }} \\] Last expression is said to be LGM if the whole set of assumptions imposed since now are met. Therefore all models that can be reduced to a LGM representation are able to host INLA methodology. From now on it is possible to write the joint posterior distribution by plugging in the likelihood (5.1) and GMRF (5.2) expression as \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid y) &amp; \\propto \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\times \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\times \\pi(y \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\times \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right) \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\times|\\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})|^{1 / 2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right) \\times \\prod_{i}^{n} \\exp \\left(\\log \\left(\\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Joining the exponentials thanks to exponents multiplicative property: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid y) \\propto \\pi(\\psi) \\times|\\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})|^{1 / 2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta}+\\sum^{n} \\log \\left(\\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] 5.2 Approximation in INLA setting INLA is not going to try to estimate the whole posterior distribution from expression (5.3). Instead it will try to estimate the posterior marginal distribution effects for each latent parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) given the hyper parameter priors specification \\(\\psi_{k}\\). Proper estimation methods however are beyond the scope of the analysis, further excellent references are suggested in their respective part by Rubio (2020) in section 2.2.2 and Blangiardo &amp; Cameletti (2015) in section 4.7.2. The integral for latent parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y})=\\int \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid \\mathbf{y}) \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid \\mathbf{y}) d \\psi \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] The posterior marginal integral for the hyper parameter is \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) since it is composed by \\(K\\) elements, i.e. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}=\\left\\{\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{K}\\right\\}\\) is: \\[ \\pi\\left(\\psi_{k} \\mid y\\right)=\\int \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid y) d \\psi_{-k} \\] where the notation \\(\\psi_{-k}\\) is a vector of hyper parameters \\(\\psi\\) without considering \\(k\\)th element \\(\\psi_{k}\\). Once again the objective is to have approximated solution for latent parameter posterior distribution. To this purpose A hierarchical structure is now imposed since the lower hyper parameter integral, whose approximation for the moment does not exist, is nested inside the upper parameter integral that takes hyper param as integrand. Hierarchical structures are welcomed very warmly since it is convenient later for hierarchical bayesian regression, approached in the next chapter 6.4). By unnesting the structure the two steps presented are mandatory: step 1: compute Laplace approximation marginals for the hyper parameters: \\(\\tilde\\pi\\left(\\psi_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)\\) step 2: compute Laplace approximation marginals for the parameters given the hyper parameter approximation: \\(\\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}\\right) \\approx \\int \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, \\boldsymbol{y}\\right) \\underbrace{\\tilde{\\pi}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y})}_{\\text {Estim. in step 1 }} \\mathrm{d} \\psi\\) Then plugging approximation in the integral observed in (5.4) it is obtained: \\[ \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid y\\right) \\approx \\int \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, y\\right) \\tilde{\\pi}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid y) \\mathrm{d} \\psi \\] In the end INLA uses the following numerical approximation to compute marginals: \\[ \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid y\\right) \\approx \\sum_{j} \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}^{(j)}, y\\right) \\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}^{(j)} \\mid y\\right) \\Delta_{j} \\] {\\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}^{(j)}\\)} are a set of values of the hyper param \\(\\psi\\) grid used for numerical integration, each of which associated to a specific weight \\(\\Delta_{j}\\).

CCD to spdetoy dataset, source Marta Blangiardo (2015) The approximation \\(\\tilde{\\pi}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid y\\right)\\) can take different forms and be computed in different ways. Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) also discuss how this approximation should be in order to reduce the numerical error (Krainski 2019). 5.2.1 further approximations (prolly do not note include) Following Gómez Rubio (2020), approximations of the joint posterior for the hyper paramer \\(\\tilde\\pi\\left(\\psi_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)\\) is used to compute the marginals for the latent effects and hyper parameters in this way: \\[ \\left.\\tilde{\\pi}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\mid \\mathbf{y}) \\propto \\frac{\\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, y)}{\\tilde{\\pi}_{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, y)}\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})} \\] In the previous equation \\(\\tilde{\\pi}_{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, y)\\) is a gaussian approximation to the full condition of the latent effect \\({\\theta}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\\) is the mode for a given value of the hyper param vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) At this point there exists three types of approximations for \\(\\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}, y\\right)\\) first with a gaussian approximation, estimating mean \\(\\mu_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_{i}^{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\\). second using the Laplace Approximation. third using simplified Laplace Approximation (rivedere meglio) 5.3 R-INLA package in a bayesian hierarchical regression perspective 5.3.1 Overview INLA computations and methodology is developed by the R-INLA project whose package is available on their website. Download is not on CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) so a special source repo link, which is maintained by authors and collaborators, has to be optioned. The website offers also a forum where a daily discussion group is opened and an active community is keen to answer. Moreover It also contains a number of reference books, among which some of them are fully open sourced as gitbook. Furthermore as Havaard Rue has pointed out in a web-lecture on the topic, the project is gaining importance due to its new applications and recent use cases, but by no means it is replacing the older MCMC methods, rather INLA can integrate pre existing procedures. The core function of the package is inla()and it works as many other regression functions like glm(), lm() or gam(). Inla function takes as arguments the formula (where are response and linear predictor) together with the data (expects a data.frame obj) on which estimation is desired. Many other alternative methods inside the function can be added with respect to the model to be imposed but are not covered here. Inla objects are inla.dataframe summary-type lists containing the results from model fitting. Results contained in the object are specified in the table below, even though some of them requires special method: (se riesco più elegante in kable) Following Krainski &amp; Rubio (2019) observations \\(y(s_{1}), \\ldots, y(s_{n})\\) are taken from a toy generated dataset and a hierarchical linear regression is fitted. summary table list object, source: Krainski (2019) 5.3.2 Linear Predictor SPDEtoy dataset, that has a spatial component, is generated from a \\(y_{i}\\) Gaussian variable; its moments are \\(\\mu_{i}\\) and precision \\(\\tau\\). SPDEtoy plot, authors source The formula that describe the linear predictor has to be called directly inside the inla() function or it can be stored in the environment into a variable. The mean moment in the gaussian distribution \\(\\mu_{i}\\) is expressed as the linear predictor \\(\\eta_{i}\\) (i.e. \\(E\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\beta_{0}, \\ldots, \\beta_{M}, x_{i 1}, \\ldots, x_{i M}\\right) = \\eta_{i}\\) ). The function that maps the linear predictor into the parameter space is identity as in section ?? i.e. \\(\\eta_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\beta_{m} x_{m i}+\\sum_{l=1}^{L} f_{l}\\left(z_{l i}\\right)\\). After including \\(s_{1}\\) and \\(s_{2}\\) spatial covariates the linear predictor takes the following form: \\(\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} s_{1 i}+\\beta_{2} s_{2 i}\\), where once again \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the fixed effect i.e. intercept and the \\(\\beta_{j}\\) are the linear effect on covariates. INLA allows also to include non-linear effects with the f() method inside the formula. Once the formula is decided then priors has to be picked up; for the intercept a customary choice is uniform. Prior for Gaussian latent parameters are vague and they have 0 mean and 0.001 precision, then the prior for \\(\\tau\\) is a Gamma with parameters 1 and 0.00005. Prior initial choice can be later adapted. The summary of the model parameters is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y_{i} &amp; \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\tau^{-1}\\right), i=1, \\ldots, 200 \\\\ \\mu_{i} &amp;=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} s_{1 i}+\\beta_{2} s_{2 i} \\\\ \\beta_{0} &amp; \\sim \\text { Uniform } \\\\ \\beta_{j} &amp; \\sim N\\left(0,0.001^{-1}\\right), j=1,2 \\\\ \\tau &amp; \\sim G a(1,0.00005) \\end{aligned} \\] ## ## Call: ## &quot;inla(formula = formula, data = SPDEtoy)&quot; ## Time used: ## Pre = 1.37, Running = 0.223, Post = 0.13, Total = 1.72 ## Fixed effects: ## mean sd 0.025quant 0.5quant 0.975quant mode kld ## (Intercept) 10.132 0.242 9.656 10.132 10.608 10.132 0 ## s1 0.762 0.429 -0.081 0.762 1.606 0.762 0 ## s2 -1.584 0.429 -2.428 -1.584 -0.740 -1.584 0 ## ## Model hyperparameters: ## mean sd 0.025quant 0.5quant ## Precision for the Gaussian observations 0.308 0.031 0.251 0.307 ## 0.975quant mode ## Precision for the Gaussian observations 0.372 0.305 ## ## Expected number of effective parameters(stdev): 3.00(0.00) ## Number of equivalent replicates : 66.67 ## ## Marginal log-Likelihood: -423.18 The output offers among the others a summary of the posterior marginal values for intercept, coefficient and covariates, as well as precision.

Data as such can monitor a vast range of phenomena, as an example disease cancer detection (Bell et al. 2006) at several sites, COVID19 spread in China (Li et al. 2020), PM pollution concentration in a North-Italian region Piemonte (Cameletti et al. 2012). Moreover house prices variation, as observed in Gómez Rubio (2020), where selling prices smoothly vary between closer neighborhoods. All the Examples taken before might document a spatial nature of data according to which closer observations can display similar values, this phenomenon is named spatial autocorrelation. Spatial models are explicitly designed to take into account this behavior and can separate spatial patterns from simply random spatial variance. Spatial data can be partitioned into three spatial data type whose modeling tools are specific with respect to their category. Areal Data Point Referenced Data Point Pattern Data point referenced data example, Milan Rental Real Estate, Authors Source REST API seen in chapter 3 extracts point referenced data, so modeling methodologies described in this analysis will exclusively take into account point referenced techniques. In order to extend the notion from discrete measurements (i.e. point referenced) to a continuous spatial surface a stochastic process, namely Gaussian Process, has to be introduced and constrained according to convenient properties. GP are then blended with a specific covariance function, i.e. Matèrn. The reason why last assumption is true will be much more clear in the next chapter 7. A class of models called Hedonic Price are borrowed from econometric literature and are used to fully integrate covariates coming from the API. Then Hedonic models are exploited into a bayesian hierarchical framework and INLA is applied as computing choice. Spatial kriging is essential to predict the process at new locations so that the surface can be plotted and analyzed. In the end models have to be checked and verified with sanpling techiniques which are once again specific to the data type and the scope of the analysis. (forse mettere alla fine come further developments) As a side note Spatial data can also be measured according to a 3rd (or even a 4th in the case elevation data) dimension which is the time component. In this setting it might be interesting to research time correlation between subsequent spatial data time points, a valuable reference is Paci et al. (2017). Therefore since API generates data on a daily basis and then stores a .json file on a DB, future research on this data might consider the idea to include the time component in the model. 6.1 Gaussian Process (GP) For simplicity lets consider \\(y\\) point of interest observations \\(y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\\right),y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\right)\\) from a random spatial process \\(Y\\), such that: \\(Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\\right),Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\\right), \\ldots, Y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\right)\\) observed at location \\(\\boldsymbol{s}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\\). In the context of geostatistical data each observation has to be considered as a partial realization of an unobserved random spatial process. \\(\\left\\{Y(s): s \\in D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right\\}\\), where surface \\(D\\) is a subset of r-dimensional Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r}\\). Moreover When \\(r = 1\\) it is the most simple stochastic process widely explored in literature i.e. time series process. However geostatistical data always have \\(r = 2\\) (i.e. lat and long, eastings and northings) or eventually \\(r = 3\\), when elevation data is available. The stochastic process \\(Y\\) is observed in a fixed set of monitoring stations and inference can be done regarding moments of the realized process. This information are essential to build a spatially continuous surface over the y-studied variable in order to predict the phenomenon at locations not yet observed. 3D scatterplot and surface, Stockton data. A collection of \\(n\\) random variables, such as \\(Y(s_{1}), Y(s_{2}) , \\ldots, Y(s_{n})\\) that are valid spatial processes are said to be a GP if for any set of spatial index \\(n\\) and for each set of corresponding locations \\(\\left\\{y\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(s_{n}\\right)\\right\\}\\) follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\left\\{\\mu\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\mu\\left(s_{n}\\right)\\right\\}\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) (Marta Blangiardo 2015). The covariance matrix relates each observation to each of the others through a spatial covariance function defined as \\(\\mathcal{C}(\\cdot)\\). The covariance function ensures that all the values that are close together in input space will produce output values that are close together. Covariance function needs to inherits the validity characteristics from the random spatial process, furthermore it has to be positive definite. Below a generalized version for two random \\(i\\)th \\(j\\)th observations: \\[\\begin{equation} \\operatorname{Cov}\\left(y\\left(s_{i}\\right), y\\left(s_{j}\\right)\\right) \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] GP in the spatial context has to meet two important properties: Stationary. Isotropy. Stationarity in a stochastic process can be strong, weak or intrinsic. The strong property forces the distribution of the process \\(\\left\\{y\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(s_{n}\\right)\\right\\}\\) for any given spatial index \\(n\\) and its correspondent location sets \\(s_{1,\\ldots,n}\\) to be the same as the one in \\(\\left\\{y\\left(s_{1}+\\boldsymbol{h}\\right), \\ldots, y\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n}+\\boldsymbol{h}\\right)\\right\\}\\), where \\(h\\) is a number belonging to \\(R^{2}\\). On the other hand the weak property ensures that if the GP mean moment is constant over the study domain \\(\\mu(\\mathbf{s}) \\equiv \\mu\\) (e.g. \\(E[Y(s)]=\\mu, \\forall s \\in D\\)) then the covariance functions does depend only on the distance (euclidean \\(\\left\\|s_{i}-s_{j}\\right\\|\\) distance) between each couple points. Weak stationarity consequences are the most interesting: It does not matter whether observations are placed either in a specific region, nor the direction towards they are oriented, the covariance functions \\(\\mathcal{C}(h)\\) can summarize the process through the separation vector \\(h\\) (Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2014). In other words weak stationarity in GP implies being invariant under translation (2019). The relationship between strong and weak is not bijective since being strong implies also being weak, but the opposite is not always true for non-Gaussian process. Furthermore since it is assumed to be true by the intrinsic stationary property that \\(E[Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s})]=0\\), the second moment of the latter expression can be written as \\(E[Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s})]^{2}\\) leading to \\(\\operatorname{Var}(Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})-Y(\\mathbf{s}))\\). Last expression is called variogram and can be expressed with \\(2 \\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\), even tough its half,i.e. \\(\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\), is more interpretable, namely semivariogram (Cressie 2015). The intuition behind the variogram is that the difference in value between two near points \\(Y(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h})\\) and \\(Y(\\mathbf{h})\\) is expected to be small with respect to the ones farther ( ergodicity of the spatial process Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand (2014) ), in compliance with the first law of geography by Tobler: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things  Waldo R. Tobler Semivariograms are an efficient tool to asses spatial continuity and contiguity but they are theoretical. However semivariograms can be fitted into existing data giving birth to empirical semivariograms which are then plotted against their separation vector. The plot can be used to verify the null hypothesis of spatial independence and variability of the process. The below expression is the empirical semivariogram functional form: \\[\\hat{\\gamma}(t)=\\frac{1}{2}|N(t)| \\sum_{\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}, \\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right) \\in N(t)}\\left(Y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)-Y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\] where \\(N(t)\\) is the set of location pairs such that \\(\\left\\|\\mathbf{s}_{i}-\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right\\|=t\\) and so \\(|N(t)|\\) is the number of pairs in the set. As already guessed before empirical semivariogram values are expected to be small at short pairs distance and tends to increase when distance increases. The rational behind is that similar observations are expected to lay close together (small \\(h\\)) leading to lower semivariogram values (\\(\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})\\)), as opposite farther pairs obervations (big \\(h\\)) tend to be different and associated to greater semivariogram values. Flat semivariogram might indicate small spatial variance, since whether separation \\(h\\) increases or not, semivariogram values remains the same \\(\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma(\\mathbf{h})}{\\Delta\\mathbf{h}}\\approx0\\). Semivariograms might be implied earlier in the modeling process to to evaluate the presence of any spatial pattern. Then they are also implied in the model checking stage with the aim to asses if any spatial pattern is still present in the residuals. (metti expressione variogram). The process is said to be Isotropic if the covariance function depends only on the between-points distance so it is invariant under rotation (2019). A further way of seeing the property is that Isotropy implies concentric decaying contours that resemble the vanishing of spatial dependence. isotropy VS anisotropy, source Blanchet-Scalliet et al. (2019) the If the last assumption does not hold and direction towards point are distant from each other in the spatial domain \\(D\\) then the process is said to be Anisotropic. \\[C(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h}, \\mathbf{s} \\mid \\theta)=\\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{R}(\\|h\\| ; \\phi)\\] Once The three main arguments in semivariograms are: range \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), nugget \\(\\tau^{2}\\) and sill \\(\\tau^{2}+\\sigma^{2}\\). range: At some offset distance, the variogram values will stop changing and reach a sort of plateau. The distance at which the effect occurs is called the range \\(\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma(\\mathrm{h})}{h} \\approx 0\\). sill: The plateau value at which the variogram stops changing \\(\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma(\\mathrm{h})}{h} = 0\\). nugget: The discontinuity at the origin. Although this theoretically should be zero, sampling error and short scale variability can cause it to be non-zero \\(\\gamma(\\mathrm{0})\\). variogram example 6.1.1 Matérn covariance function There are many covariance functions and their application depend both on data and the scope on the analysis. Examples of spatial covariance functions among all the others are: Linear, Spherical, Exponential and Matérn. Matérn is special since when it is used together with a GP, the SPDE approach can provide a GMRF representation of the same process, chapter 7 undisclose this fundamental property. Matérn can also be accounted as the most used in geostatistics (Krainski et al. 2018) and (Gómez Rubio 2020). Matérn is tuned mainly by two parameters, a scaling one \\(\\kappa&gt;0\\) (the most of the times set equal to the range) and a smoothing one \\(\\nu&gt;0\\). By decomposing it into a more granular form and cosidering two generic locations \\(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}_{j}\\), a stationary and isotropic Matérn correlation function (Krainski et al. 2018) has this form \\[ \\operatorname{Cor}_{Matérn}\\left(U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right), U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}\\left(\\kappa\\left\\|\\mathbf{s}_{i}-\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right\\|\\right)^{\\nu} K_{\\nu}\\left(\\kappa\\left\\|\\mathbf{s}_{i}-\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right\\|\\right) \\] where \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) is the Euclidean distance, \\(\\Gamma(\\cdot)\\) is a gamma function and \\(K_{\\nu}(\\cdot)\\) is a modified Bessel function of second kind. The relationship that ties Matérn correlation and covariance is \\(\\mathcal{C}(h_{i,j}) = \\operatorname{Cov}_{Matérn}\\left(U\\left(\\mathrm{s}_{i}\\right), U\\left(\\mathrm{s}_{j}\\right)\\right) = \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\operatorname{Cor}_{M}\\left(U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right), U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right)\\right)\\). Then if \\(u(\\mathbf{s})\\) is a realization from \\(U(\\mathbf{s})\\) at \\(n\\) locations the joint covariance matrix can be defined as each entry of the joint covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_{i, j}= \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\operatorname{Cor}_{M}\\left(U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right), U\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\right)\\right)\\). Common customary choice is to assume that \\(U(.)\\) in centered in 0. 6.2 Hedonic Price Models for Rental House Market The theoretical foundation of the Hedonic Price Models (from now on HPM) relies on the consumer utility theory of Lancasters (1966) and in Rosens model [Rosen, 1974]. The general principle in HPM suggests that the value of a commodity can be calculated by the estimated values of its separate properties. Applying HPM to real estate, house pricing (but also renting) is given by the unit cost of each household characteristic, therefore the expenditures associated with them. More generally the discussion might be also opened to how much adding a household expenditure impacts the total price of the house [letteratura]. It can be also extended to how much a new infrastructure (transports, new public places) will drive house price value [letteratura]. Both of the two points mentioned are interesting research prospects but are beyond the scope of the analysis. According to HPM Hedonic Price function establishes a general functional relationship between the observed household expenditures on housing, \\(P(C)\\), and the level of characteristics contained in vector \\(C\\). \\(P(C)=f\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)\\). A first attempt to include spatial effect in urban economic literature is provided by Alonso (1964). Its contribution was to raise voice on house prices (also rent) mainly depending on land price and a number of purely spatial covariates like CBD, the distance from City Business District. Other covariates were transport cost per kilometer and community income, even though they were defined also as spatial parameters through distances. The model proposed by Alonso is called monocentric since the centroid from which distances are calculated is only one. Moreover a first touch to spatial data thory was done since the CBD was defined as areal unit with well-defined boundaries of regular or irregular shape. However Applications of the model were not convincing since obervations offered a different picture. Results instead displayed a Poly-centric areal structure (universities and Malls) which might have driven prices. The model also assumed that covariates like CBD are only informative within city center boundaries and then displayed no significance out of the core of the city. Poly-centric theory was also more coherent with the architectural and socio-economical evolution of cities during recent times, therefore mono centric theory was then criticized and abandoned. Critics regarded also neighborhood quality measure and boundary problems Dubin (1987). Dubin for these reasons developed a geostatistical model including areal effects in the error term since handling these covariates was posing several hard challenges. Here relies part of the reason why the problem in this analysis is approached as point reference and not as areal. During literature evolution on HPM, as it is already been explained, discussions on vector \\(C\\) have risen. Though generally they can be grouped into two macro domains: Residential structure characteristics, such as: house size, and the number of rooms, number of bathrooms (inner data effect) Effects associated with the geographic location (locational effects), both between houses and within other existing infrastructures, events or areas. (outer data effect) For the scope of the analysis residential structure covariates and locational between houses effects are considered. Exogenous effects such as crime rate and transports are not included in the model since prices and rents are already incorporating that information. As a final remark scholars would argue that rent values do not represent the actual value of real estate. Nevertheless in empirical analysis rent value are considered a proxy for the price of real estate (Herath and Maier 2011). A further argument to endorse this hypothesis is brought by Manganelli, Morano, and Tajani (2013) considering housing a commodity, then the selling or the rental should be considered interchangeable economic actions with respect to same inner need to satisfy. This assumption is also stronger than the previous since the latter statement is referred to analysis based on italian real estate data. Moreover Capozza and Seguin (1996) discussed about how much rent-price ratio predicts future changes both in rents and prices. Among other issues raised they pinpointed the decomposition of rent-price ratio into two parts: the predictable part and the unexplained residuals part. The predictable part was in negative relationship with price changes, in other words cities in which prices are relatively high with respect to rents are associated with higher capital gains that justifies that misalignment. This is also true for the opposite, that is cities in which prices are higher with respect to the rents, and this can not be associated to any local condition, realizes lower capital gains. One other demonstration of price-rent exchangeablity and strong correlation is offered by Clark (Clark 1995) which traces the Capozza and Seguin work. Rent-price ratio is negatively correlated with following future changes in rents. In other words prices are still higher when areas in which they are observed documents an increase in rent prices. All the literature review above is oriented to a long-run alignment of price and rent. 6.3 Regression for univariate spatial data Since in HPM the relationships between the characteristics of the house, i.e. vector \\(C\\), and the price \\(P(C)\\) is not defined in economic literature it is possible to assume any \\(f\\) functional form that relates covariates. The open possibility to apply any relationship between covariates comes very handy in the INLA setting, since Latent Gaussian Models are prepared to accept a wide range of \\(f\\) linear and non linear functions that model covariates 5.1. Hedonic price models are, as a consequence, a subset of models that can be fitted into LGM and therefore by INLA method. Moreover what the latest econometric literature (Greene, 2018) suggests is to apply a log-linear model. This is due to the fact that the transformation smooths the skewness of prices leading to best estimates. Moreover it gives an intuitive suggestion on percent price variation through betas thanks to logarithm properties. This argumentation as Greene suggests can be extended also to rent prices. If it assumed a log-linear model then a classical bayesian non-spatial linear regression can relate a \\(log(y)\\) response variable with its covariates and error through the expression: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log(y_{i})=\\mu_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i} \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{i}\\) is normally distributed as \\(y_{i} \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma^{2}\\right)\\) and \\(\\mu_{i}\\) is the mean structure that might linearly depend on some \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) covariates, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) coefficients and \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) white noise error. The linear predictor as is chapter 5.1 can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\eta_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_{j} x_{i m} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] where the \\(i\\)th pedix is the observation index and the \\(j\\)th pedix is the mth covariate. Moreover it is possible to specify \\(\\eta\\) as a function of \\(\\mu\\). The link function between them in this case is identity, so that \\(\\eta_{i}=g\\left(\\mu_{i}\\right)=\\mu_{i}\\). In GLMs when response variable has to stay between \\([0,1]\\) (e.g. probabilities), the link function might be Logit, which leads to logistic regression. More generally expressed in vector notation: \\[\\begin{equation} y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{x}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)^{\\prime} \\beta_{j}+\\varepsilon\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right) \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] where its OLS estimator is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\beta}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] However in many cases non-linear functions, like basis function might be a smoother solution to model coordinates when used as covariates (Krainski et al. 2018). Moreover In the context of bayesian analysis a prior distribution has to be imposed on the regression coefficients \\(\\beta = \\left\\{\\beta_{0}, \\ldots, \\beta_{J}\\right\\}\\) as well ad on the variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) of \\(y_{i}\\). When no expert information is provided vague priors are introduced, meaning that the regression should not be weighted too much on the priors choice. Vague priors might be: \\(\\beta_{m} \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}\\left(0,10^{6}\\right)\\) for the beta coefficients \\(\\log (\\tau)=\\log \\left(1 / \\sigma^{2}\\right) \\sim \\log \\operatorname{Gamma}\\left(1,10^{-5}\\right)\\) for precision When leveraging information from location the added \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) has to be introduced in the previous equation (6.4). \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) surface is required in order to incorporate spatial error into regression settings, as well as enabling prediction over the entire domain \\(D\\): \\[y\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{x}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}+w(\\mathbf{s})+\\varepsilon\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)\\] The \\(w(\\mathbf{s})\\) in the context of the analysis is approached as a stationary and isotropic GP6.1 whose distribution is multivariate Gaussian with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\mathbf{s}) = 0\\) and function of the spatial index \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) and covariance function \\(\\mathcal{C}( \\cdot \\mid \\theta)\\) . \\(\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{s})\\) is iid and mean centered in 0 with variance \\(\\tau^{2}\\) and is called non-spatial error since it contributes to the nugget. The error term is pure since it interferes with the covariance function so that the model can embody the spatial component. One of the major advantages of having a a spatial process embedded into a GP is likelihood based inference. 6.3.1 Parameter estimation Gaussian spatial models can be considered as GLM with a particular specification of the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_{\\theta}=\\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{R}(\\phi)+\\tau^{2} I_{n}\\), then the likelihood can be computed by: \\[\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\sim \\mathrm{N}\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\beta, \\Sigma_{\\theta}\\right)\\] where, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\left(\\sigma^{2}, \\tau^{2}, \\phi\\right)\\) Since likelihood estimation is possible then MLE can be computed for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) are \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\). Then the estimation in vector notation is: \\[\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{M L E}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\Sigma^{-1} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\Sigma^{-1} \\mathbf{y}\\] 6.4 Hierarchical Bayesian Regression Spatial Models are characterized by many parameters which at their time might be tuned by some other hyper-parameters. Taking a few steps back the problem can be reformulated into a easier setting starting from grouping observation into categories and then trying to impose a hierarchical structure on data based on these categories. Therefore observations might fall into different categories, underlining their natural characteristics, such as: some of them might belong to category levels like males or females, married or not-married. Moreover diving into the specific problem house prices can be faceted by which floor they belong or whether they are assigned to different energy classes and many others more. As an example Blangiardo and Cameletti (2015) consider grouping data according to just one 9-levels-category factor. Data for the reasons stated before can be organized in a way such that each single observation (squares in figure below) belongs to its respective mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories (circles in figure). simplifing_problem Moreover data can be also conveniently partitioned into two meta-categories: fist level and second level. First level are identified by sampling observations which are drawn by the same probability distribution. Second level (circles) are categories and might be associated to a set of parameters \\(\\theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{J}\\right\\}\\). Since the structure is hierarchical, a DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) (2015) representation might sort out ideas. If categories are represented by different thetas nodes \\(\\theta\\) and edges are the logical belonging condition to the precise category then: To fully take into account the hierarchical structure of the data, \\(\\left\\{\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{J}\\right\\}\\) is assumed to come from a distribution \\(\\pi\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid \\psi\\right)\\) characterized by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}=\\left\\{\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{K}\\right\\}\\) hyper parameters, left figure. If \\(\\theta_{j}\\) come from the same distribution they are assumed also to be sharing information (Marta Blangiardo 2015). In a hierarchical framework this can be reformulated by: \\[ \\pi\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{J} \\mid \\psi\\right)=\\int \\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\pi\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid \\psi\\right) \\pi(\\psi) \\mathrm{d} \\psi \\] theta \\(\\theta_{j}\\) parameters are similar in the sense they come from the same distribution family characterized by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) hyper parameters, which at their own time are identified by priors (fixed quantities). This structure can extended to allow more than two levels of hierarchy since the marginal distributions of \\(\\theta\\) can be decomposed into the product of their conditional distribution given some hyperparameter \\(\\psi\\) as well as their prior distribution \\(p(\\psi)\\). \\[ \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\int \\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1}\\right) \\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{2}\\right) \\ldots \\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{L-1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{L}\\right) \\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{L}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1} \\ldots \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{L} \\] \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{l}\\) identifies the hyper pram for the l th level of hierarchy. The property to enable deeper nested hyperparameters (i.e. add \\(L\\) hierarchy levels) is said Exchangeability and allows to extend the dimensions in which the problem in evaluated (spatio-temporal models). From a theoretical point of view there is no constraints to how many \\(L\\) levels to consider, as a consequence model interpretability suffers from adding too many layers. 6.5 INLA as a hierarchical model [va parafrasato] The model can be then rewritten in LGM terms following section 5.1, within the bayesian hierarchical structure. This enables INLA computation and its benefits. The first level belongs to the sampling distribution for \\(y\\), which are conditional to parameter and hyper parameter given the latent field \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\) and the hyper parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\): \\[ \\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1} \\sim \\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\pi\\left(y_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{1}\\right) \\] Then at the second level the latent field \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is characterized by a multivariate Normal distribution given all the other hyper parameters \\(\\psi_{2}\\): \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{2} \\sim \\mathrm{MVNormal}\\left(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\boldsymbol{Q}^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{2}\\right)\\right) \\] Finally, the hyperparameters \\(\\boldsymbol{v}=\\left\\{\\psi_{1}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{2}\\right\\}\\) have some prior distribution given by \\(\\psi \\sim \\pi(\\psi)\\) 6.6 Spatial Kriging fallo da slides paci e banerjee sudipto Kriging is the operation according which given \\(y\\) observation it is possible to predict over \\(\\mathbf{s}_{0}\\) new locations not yet observed.

Before INLA, GP were treated as multivariate Gaussian densities and Cholesky factorization were applied on the covariance matrices and then fitted with likelihood. Matrices in this settings are very dense and they scale with the order of \\(O\\left(n^{3}\\right)\\), leading to a big-n problem. The breakthrough, came with Lindgren, Rue, and Lindström (2011) that proves that a stationary, isotropic GP with Matérn covariance and special covariance parameters can be represented as a GMRF using SPDE solutions by finite element method. Benefits are many but the most important is that the representation of the GP through a GMRF provides a sparse precision matrix. Sparse matrices enable convenient inner computation properties of GMRF that can be applied with INLA. Bayesian inference on GMRF can take advantage of lower computational cost because of sparsity that leads to a big-o \\(O\\left(n^{3 / 2}\\right)\\).
