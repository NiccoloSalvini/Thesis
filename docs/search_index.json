Data can be filtered out On the basis of the options set in the API endpoint argument body. Some of the options might regard the city in which it is aevaluated the real estate market, npages as the number of pages to be scraped, type as the choice between rental of selling. For further documentation on how to structure the API endpoint query refer to section ??. Since to the analysis purposes data should come from the same source (e.g. Milan rental real estate within circonvallazione) a dedicated endpoint boolean option .thesis is passed in the argument body. What the API option under the hood is doing is specifying a structured and already filtered URL to be passed to the scraping endppoint. By securing the same URL to the scraping functions data is forced to come from the same URL source. The idea behind this concept can be thought as refreshing everyday the same immobiliare.it URL. API endpoint by default also specifies 10 pages to be scraped, in this case 120 is provided leading to to 3000 data points. The * refers to the EC2 public DNS that is ec2-18-224-40-67.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com http://*/complete/120/milano/affitto/.thesis=true As a further source data can also be accessed through the mondgoDB credentials with the cloud ATLAS database by picking up the latest .csv file generated. For run time reasons also related to the bookdown files continuous building the API endpoint is called the day before the presentation so that the latest .csv file is available. As a consequence code chunks outputs are all cached due to heavy computation. A preliminary exploratory analysis evidences 34 covariates and 250 rows. Immoboliare.it furnishes many information regarding property attributes and estate agency circumstances. Data displays many NA in some of the columns but georeference coordinates, due to the design of scraping functions, are in any case present. library(readr) ## Warning: package &#39;readr&#39; was built under R version 4.0.3 library(kableExtra) library(tidyverse) ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.0 -- ## v ggplot2 3.3.2 v dplyr 1.0.2 ## v tibble 3.0.4 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v tidyr 1.1.2 v forcats 0.5.0 ## v purrr 0.3.4 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39;
