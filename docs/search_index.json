It can be done automatically, simultaneously as well as by scheduler at certain fixed times. Given the substantial unavailability of fresh data and the absence of API’s to call regarding Milan Real Estate rental markets, this practice has to be applied. The main idea and hope is to open source the scraping so that in the future further analysis will be available without putting effort in gathering data. Content distribution is managed by HTTP protocols, which are a common standard to connect web clients. Web browsers (i.e. one among the others web clients) download the content and parses them making possible to read them_The athomical unit of measurement in scraping is the url, which are the locations where this data exchanges abstractly happens. [ questo in API infra ] Data/content in webpages is the most of the times well organized and accessible. This is made possible by the effort put into building both the website structure and the content architecture. For website structure it is meant the way urls, pointing to webpages, are arranged throughout the website. Website structure constitutes a first dimension of hierarchy. Some popular structures examples might regard social-networks where posts can be scrolled down within a single page named the wall pretty. Scrolling down might end due to fewer posts, but the perception is a never ending webpage associated to a single url. Instead personal profiles are dedicated to a specified unique url and even in profiles posts are allocated into a sub domain and might be scrolled down arranged by time since the day of social subscription. Online newspapers display their articles in the front wall and by accessing to one of them all the related following articles sometimes can be reached by some sort of arrow, pointing right or left. Articles can also be suggested and the more the website is explored the more articles are likely to be suggested twice ending up into a suggestion loop (i.e. recursive structures are popular in newspaper websites). Online Retailers as Amazon, based on filters, groups inside a single webpage (i.e. page n° 1) a fixed set of items, having their dedicated personal url attached to them. Furthermore Amazon offers the opportunity to skip to the following page (i.e. page n° 2), searching for another different and fixed set of items and so on until the ending url. Generally website structures try to reflect both the user expectations with respect to the product on the website and the design expression of the web developer. For these reasons for each websites usage category exists a multitude of content architectures for multiple front end languages for multiple end users. Web design in scraping plays an important role since the more sophisticated graphical technologies are implied, the harder will be to scrape information. general website structure A second dimension of hierarchy is brought by content architecture in the name of the language used for content creation and organization i.e. HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and … HTML drives the hierarchy structure that is then generalized to the website structure. According to this point of view the hierarchical website structure is a consequence of the content architecture by means of HTML language. CSS language stands for Cascading Style Sheets and takes care of the style of the webpage. The combination of HTML and CSS offers a wide flexibility in building web sites, once again expressed by the vast amount of different designs on the web. Some websites’ components also might be tuned by Javascript language, which in the context of scraping adds a further layer of difficulty. As a matter of fact since Javascript components are dynamic within the webpage, scraping requires specialized libraries to enable different parser to get the content. Scraping exploits CSS language to structure its queries within the webpage. CSS allows the scraper to target a class of objects in the web page that shares same style (e.g. same css query) so that each element that belongs to the class can be gathered. This practice provides enormous advantages since by CSS a set of objects can be obtained within a single function call. In this case the hierarchy as already pointed out First and Second dimension of the scraping problem imply hierarchy, a simple way to approach the problem is to represent it through already known data structures. One way to imagine hierarchy in both of the two dimensions are graph based data structures named as Rooted Trees. By analyzing the first dimension through the lenses of Rooted trees it is possible to compress the whole problem into the general graph based jargon (Diestel 2006). Rooted trees must start with a root node which is the dominimum of the web page. Each Node is a url destination and each Edge is the connection between nodes. Connections have been made possible in the website by nesting urls inside webpages so that within a single webpage the user can access to a number of other related links. Furthermore, as an extension to the rooted tree framework a general graph theory component is introduced, i.e. the Weight. Each edge is associated to a weight whose interpretation is the run time cost to walk from a node to its respective following children node (e.g. from a url to the other). In addition the content inside each node takes the name of payload, which ultimately is the scope of the scraping processes. The walk from node 17 to node 8 in figure below (even though that is the case of a binary rooted tree) is called path and it represented as an ordered list of nodes connected by edges. In this context each node can have both a fixed and variable outgoing sub-nodes that are called Children . When root trees have a fixed set of children are called k-ary rooted trees, i.e. 9 and 5 nodes left in figure since it is a binary children are two. A node is said to be Parent to other nodes when it is connected to them by outgoing edge, in right figure below “head” is the parent of nodes “title” and “meta”. Nodes in the tree that shares the same parent node are said Siblings. Moreover Subtrees are a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and its descendants e.g. node “body” with all of its descendants might constitute a subtree. The concept of subtree in both of the dimensions plays crucial role in cutting run time scraping procesess. If the website strucuture is locally reproducible and the content architecture within webpages tends to be the equal, then functions for a single subtree might be extended to the rest of others subtrees that shares the same parent node. In addition two more metrics have to be considered level and height. The level of a node \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) counts the number of edges on the path from the root node to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). The height is the maximum level for any node in the tree, from now on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). HTML strucure, Vincenzo Nardelli creations 2.2 Immobiliare.it Webscraping website structure Immobiliare follows the website strucutre … and content architecture … What scraping is supposed to achieve is to access within nodes through edges, minimizing the total run time of the functions. The main concept is to lower the number of nodes, weighting the path by the edges’ weights. By that is becomes a shortest path problem and a number of algorithm are available for this purposes. Since searchingGiven that the weights involved in the graph are not significantly different one from the other this can be called an Unweighted graph The idea designed in this project is to apply a Once provided the root node (concerning the scraping goals) all the paths are available to be reached. Scraping for all the reasons explained depends on the website the scraper has chosen to extract information from. The graph structure below sketches how scraping has been especially designed for immobiliare.it. immobiliare html tree struc children_str The root node allows to generate all the subsequent, ideally parallel root nodes. Parallel root nodes have the same html structure of the “original” root nodes. The difference between root url page 1 and 2 relies in appending at the end of the url the corresponding page number reference the user is in. This can be conveniently done with a str_c() pasting at the end of the “original” root url \"&amp;page=1\", \"&amp;page=2\", \"&amp;page=3\" until the ending criteria is matched. The criteria by author choice is to fix the number to 300. Within each root url the children href nodes are stored. Href nodes have as payloads the single rental ad url. A dedicated scraping function has been scripted in order to grab these urls scrape_href() so that they can be own root nodes to further single rental ad scraping. Right inside the html children nodes are stored the most important covariates. 2.3 Immobiliare.it Webscraping content architecture The approcah followed is to generate all the root nodes url with the aim to then generate all the children urls. The first passage is mandatory since 2.4 Scraping Best Practices and Robot.txt Robots.txt files are (rivedi citation) a way to kindly ask webbots, spiders, crawlers, wanderers and the like to access or not access certain parts of a webpage. The de facto ‘standard’ never made it beyond a informal “Network Working Group INTERNET DRAFT”. Nonetheless, the use of robots.txt files is widespread (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt, https://www.google.com/robots.txt) and bots from Google, Yahoo and the like will adhere to the rules defined in robots.txt files, although their interpretation of those rules might differ. Robots.txt files are plain text and always found at the root of a website’s domain. The syntax of the files in essence follows a fieldname: value scheme with optional preceding user-agent: … lines to indicate the scope of the following rule block. Blocks are separated by blank lines and the omission of a user-agent field (which directly corresponds to the HTTP user-agent field) is seen as referring to all bots. # serves to comment lines and parts of lines. Everything after # until the end of line is regarded a comment. Possible field names are: user-agent, disallow, allow, crawl-delay, sitemap, and host. For further notions (Meissner and Ren 2020, @google:robottxt) Some interpretation problems: finding no robots.txt file at the server (e.g. HTTP status code 404) implies that everything is permitted subdomains should have there own robots.txt file if not it is assumed that everything is allowed redirects involving protocol changes - e.g. upgrading from http to https - are followed and considered no domain or subdomain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the - robots.txt file for the original domain redirects from subdomain www to the doamin is considered no domain change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the robots.txt file for the subdomain originally requested For the thesis purposes it has been designed a dedicated function to inspect whether the domain requires specific actions or prevents some activity on thw target website. The following checkpermission() function has been integrated inside the scraping architecture and it is called once at the very beginning. library(robotstxt) dominio = &quot;immobiliare.it&quot; checkpermission = function(dom) { robot = robotstxt(domain = dom) vd = robot$check()[1] if (vd) { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt for&quot;, dom, &quot;is okay with scraping!&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;\\nrobot.txt does not like what you&#39;re doing&quot;) ## stop() } } checkpermission(dominio) ## ## robot.txt for immobiliare.it is okay with scraping! Further improvements in this direction came from the polite package (Perepolkin 2019) which combines the power of the robotstxt, the ratelimitr to rate-limiting requests and the memoise for response caching. This package is wrapped up around 3 simple but effective ideas: The three pillars of a polite session are seeking permission, taking slowly and never asking twice. The three pillars constitute the Ethical web scraping manifesto (Densmore 2019) which are common shared practises that are aimed to self regularize scrapers. This has not nothing to do with law but since many scrapers themselves, as website administrators or analyst, have fought with bots. Bots might fake out real client logs and might stain analytics, so here it is born the choice to fine common ground and politely ask for permission. 2.5 User agents, Proxies, Handlers HTTP requests to the website server by web clients come with some mandatory information packed in it. The process according to which HTTP protocols allow to exchage information can be easily thought with an analogy coming from real wordl. As a generic person A rings the door’s bell of person B’s house. A comes to B door with its personal information, its name, surname, where he lives etc. At this point B may either answer to A requests by opening the door and let him enter given the set of information he has, or it may not since B is not sure of the real intentions of A. This typical everyday situation in nothing more what happens billions of times on the internet everyday, the user (in the example above A) is interacting with a server website (part B) sending packets of information. If a server does not trust the information provided by the user, if the requests are too many, if the requests seems to be scheduled due to fixed sleeping time, a server can block the requests. In certain cases it can even forbid the user to be on the website. The language the two parties talks are coded in numbers that ranges from 100 to 511, each of which ha its own significance. A popular case of this type of interaction occurs when users are not connected to internet so the server responds 404, page not found. Servers are built with a immune-system like software that raises barriers and block users to prevent dossing or other illegal practices. How Web Works This procedure is a day to day issue to people that are trying to collect information from websites. Google does it everyday with its spider crawlers, which are very sophisticated bots that performs scarping over a enormous range of websites. This challenge can be addressed in multiple ways, there are some specific Python packages that overcome this issue. The are also certain types of scraping as the Selenium web driver automation that simulates browser automation. Selenium allows the user not to be easily detected by the server immune system and peaceful. In here precautions have not been taken lightly, and a simple but effective approach is proposed. 2.5.1 User agents Spoofing A user agent (“User Agent: Learn Your Web Browsers User Agent Now” 2020) is a string of characters in each web browser that serves as an identification agent. The user agent permits the web server to be able to identify the user operating system and the browser. Then, the web server uses the exchanged information to determine what content should be presented to particular operating systems and web browsers on a series of devices. The user agent string contains the user application or software, the operating system (and their versions), the web client, the web client’s version, and the web engine responsible for the content display (such as AppleWebKit). The user agent string is sent in form of a HTTP request header. Since the User Agents acts as middle man between the client request and the server response what it would be better doing is to actively faking it so that each time a web browser presents himself to a web server it has a different specifications, different web client, different operating system and so on. The simple approach followed was building a vector of samples of different existing and updated User Agents (UA). Then whenever a request from a browser is served to a web server 1 random string is drawn from the user agents pool. So each time the user is sending the requests it appears to have a different “identity”. Below the user agents rotating pool: set.seed(27) agents = c(&quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/602.2.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.1 Safari/602.2.14&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0&quot;) agents[sample(1)] ## [1] &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36&quot; An improvement to this could be using also rotating proxies. A proxy server acts as a gateway between the user and the server. It’s an intermediary server himself, separating end clients from the websites they are browsing. Proxy servers provide varying layers of functionality, security, and privacy are some of the examples. While the user is exploiting a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the server you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. Many proxy servers are offered in a paid version so in this case since security barriers of the target website are not high they will not be implemented. It has to be mentioned that many online services are providing free proxies but the turnaround of this solutions are many, two of them are: - Proxies to be free are widely shared among people, so as long as someone has used them for illegal purposes the user is inheriting their mistakes when caught. - Some of those proxies, pretty all the ones coming from low ranked websites, are tracked so there might be a user privacy violation issue. 2.5.2 Handlers During scraping many difficulties might be met. Starting from the things that have been previously explained at the chapter start. Some of them are: a varying url structure so that the html tree hierarchies are changed, payloads are not correctly parsed with respect to previous scraping sessions. ending with the ones that have just been said a few lines ago. Handlers and trycatch error workarounds are explicitly built in this sense. The continuous testing of the scraping functioning while developing has required the maintainer to track where the error occurs. A few numbers: the “agglomerative” function get.data.catsing() triggers more than 36 scrapping functions that are going to catch 36 different data pieces. If one of them went missing then the other one would be missing too. Then when row-data is binded together one entry column might not exists making the process fail. Then the solution to that is to call inside the aggolmerative function as much as trycatch as many scrapping functions are involved. The trycatch can leverage the gap by introducing a specified quantity and alerting that something went wrong. On top of that many other handlers are called throughout the procedure: get_ua() verifies that the user agent coming from the session request is not the default one get_ua = function(sess) { stopifnot(is.session(sess)) stopifnot(is_url(sess$url)) ua = sess$response$request$options$useragent return(ua) } is_url() verifies that the url input needed has the canonic form. This is done by a REGEX query. is_url = function(url) { re = &quot;^(?:(?:http(?:s)?|ftp)://)(?:\\\\S+(?::(?:\\\\S)*)?@)?(?:(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;](?:-)*)*(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;])+)*(?:\\\\.(?:[a-z0-9¡-&lt;ef&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;&lt;U+00BF&gt;]){2,})(?::(?:\\\\d){2,5})?(?:/(?:\\\\S)*)?$&quot; grepl(re, url) } .get_delay() checks through the robotxt file if a delay between each request is kindly welcomed. .get_delay = function(domain) { message(sprintf(&quot;Refreshing robots.txt data for %s...&quot;, domain)) cd_tmp = robotstxt::robotstxt(domain)$crawl_delay if (length(cd_tmp) &gt; 0) { star = dplyr::filter(cd_tmp, useragent==&quot;*&quot;) if (nrow(star) == 0) star = cd_tmp[1,] as.numeric(star$value[1]) } else { 10L } } get_delay = memoise::memoise(.get_delay) 2.6 Scraping with rvest To start a general scraping function it is required a target url i.e. the root node. Then a html_session object, which is the analogue of a GET/POST HTTP request, is created and opened by specifying the root url and the request data that the user might need to send to the web server, (see left part to the dashed line of the image below). Server request are handled by httr since it is the R-gold-standard for server GET and POST HTTP requests and also a dependency of rvest. Information to be attached to the web server request have been already explored in the previous sections, tough they are mainly three: User Agents, emails references and proxy servers. Once the connection is established (request response 200) all the following operations rely on the opened session, in other words for the time being in the session the user will be authorized with the provided characteristics through the request. One of the major privileges of the structure represented below is the iterability along a predefined set of parent/root urls. Since all the parent url can be generated by the first, the structure is self containing and portable. What it is worth noting is that inside each url other sub-urls are given. Those urls are the ones corresponding to each single rental advetisement that have to be inspected singularly one by one by the workflow represented below. What it comes in the right part of the dashed vertical line is a succession of functions that follow a logical step by step path. rvest under the hood handles, in this precise order: reading the html structure of the web page within the session read_html(), parsing the html content looking for a single node html_nodes() and then converting it into readable text html_text(). The entire process can be thought as sort of autoencoder by adding decoding layer after layer on top of the starting url, until reaching the final requested node. the reason why the process appear straightforward is a result of the bleding of rvest together with the tidyverse pipe %&gt;% operator. Below it is shown a function that scrapes the price and composes the API. scrapeprice.imm = function(session) { opensess = read_html(session) price = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&quot;.im-mainFeatures__title&quot;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if(is.null(price) || identical(price, character(0))) { price2 = opensess %&gt;% html_nodes(css =&#39;.im-features__value , .im-features__title&#39;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_trim() if (&quot;prezzo&quot; %in% price2) { pos = match(&quot;prezzo&quot;,price2) return(price2[pos+1]) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;€&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } else { return(NA_character_) } } else { return(price) %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(&quot;€&quot;=&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\.&quot;=&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% str_extract( &quot;\\\\-*\\\\d+\\\\.*\\\\d*&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace_na() %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;Prezzo Su Richiesta&quot;) } } The function takes as a single argument a session which is established in one other function. Then It reads the session storing the information into an obj called the opensess. Another obj is created, namely price, right after the pipe operator a css query into the html is called. The css query .im-mainFeatures__title points to a precise data stored in immobiliare web page header, right below the main title. Expectation are that price is a one-element chr vector, containing the price and some other unnecessary characters. Then the algorithm enters into the first if statement. The handler checks is the object price is empty. If it doesn’t the algorithm jumps to the end and returns the cleaned quantity. But If it does it takes again the opensess and redirect to a second css query .im-features__value , .im-features__title where price, once again, could be found. Please note that This is all done within the same session, so no more request information has to be sent. Since the latter css query points to data stored inside a list, for the time being the newly created obj price2 is a list containing various information. Then the flow enters into the second if statement that checks whether \"prezzo\" is in the list or not, if it does it returns the +1 position index element with respect to the “prezzo” positioning. This happens because data in price2 list are stored by couples sequentially, say: [title, “Appartamento Sempione”, energy class, “G”, “prezzo”, 1200/al mese]. When it returns the element corresponding to +1 position index it applies also some data wrangling with stringr to keep out overabundant characters. The function then escapes in the else statement by setting price2 = NA_Character_. the Character quality has to be imposed due to fact that if the function is evaluated for a url and returns a quantity x and then is evaluated for url2 and outputs NA (no character) then results can not be combined into dataframe. The skeleton shown can be shared among the other scraping functions, what it changes is the item “prezzo” which is then replaced by other covariates reasearched, say energy class etc. Moreover some other functions need to have heavy cleaning steps in order to be usable. As a consequence functions need also to be broken down into pieces by single .R files, so that they can be adapted with respect to their singular necessities, see the nex paragraph. Once all the functions have been created they need to be called together and then data coming after them need to be combined. This is done by get,data.catsing() which at first checks the validity of the url, then takes the same url as input and filters it as a session object. Then simultaneously all the functions are called and then combined. All this happens inside a foreach parallel loop called by scrape.all.info() scrape.all.info = function(url = &quot;https://www.immobiliare.it/affitto-case...&quot;, vedi = FALSE, scrivi = FALSE, silent = FALSE){ if (silent) { start = as_hms(Sys.time()); cat(&#39;Starting the process...\\n\\n&#39;) message(&#39;\\nThe process has started in&#39;,format(start,usetz = TRUE)) } # open parallel multisession cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) #using max cores - 1 for parallel processing registerDoParallel(cl) start = as_hms(Sys.time()) if (silent) { message(&#39;\\n\\nStart all the requests at time:&#39;, format(start,usetz = T)) } ALL = foreach(i = seq_along(links), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .multicombine = FALSE, .export =&quot;links&quot; , .verbose = TRUE, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;utils.R&quot;) sourceEntireFolder(&quot;functions_singolourl&quot;) get.data.catsing = function(singolourl){ # dormi() # if(!is_url(singolourl)){ stop(paste0(&quot;The following url does not seem either to exist or it is invalid&quot;, singolourl)) } session = html_session(singolourl, user_agent(agents[sample(1)])) if (class(session) == &quot;session&quot;) { session = session$response } id = tryCatch({scrapehouse.ID(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapehouse.ID&quot;) }) lat = tryCatch({scrapelat.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelat.imm&quot;) }) long = tryCatch({scrapelong.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapelong.imm&quot;) }) location = tryCatch({take.address(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in take.address&quot;) }) condom = tryCatch({scrapecondom.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapecondom.imm&quot;) }) buildage = tryCatch({scrapeagebuild.imm(session)}, error = function(e){ message(&quot;some problem occured in scrapeagebuild.imm&quot;) }) ... combine = tibble(ID = id, LAT = lat, LONG = long, LOCATION = location, CONDOM = condom, BUILDAGE = buildage, ... return(combine) } stopCluster(cl) return(ALL) } Below it is printed the tree structure folder that composes the main elements of the scraping procedure. It can be spotted that the two folders, namely functions_singolourl and functions_url enclose all the single functions that allows to grab single information from session. Folders with a customized function are then sourced within the two main functions, scrape.all and scrape.all.info so data can be extracted. levelName 1 immobiliare.it-WebScraping 2 ¦--functions_singolourl 3 ¦ ¦--0scrapesqfeetINS.R 4 ¦ ¦--0scrapenroomINS.R 5 ¦ ¦--0scrapepriceINS.R 6 ¦ ¦--0scrapetitleINS.R 7 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAdDate.R 8 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAge.R 9 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAgeBuilding.R 10 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAirConditioning.R 11 ¦ ¦--ScrapeAptChar.R 12 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCatastInfo.R 13 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCompart.R 14 ¦ ¦--ScrapeCondom.R 15 ¦ ¦--ScrapeContr.R 16 ¦ ¦--ScrapeDisp.R 17 ¦ ¦--ScrapeEnClass.R 18 ¦ ¦--ScrapeFloor.R 19 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHasMulti.R 20 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHeating.R 21 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseID.R 22 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHouseTxtDes.R 23 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLAT.R 24 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLONG.R 25 ¦ ¦--ScrapeLoweredPrice.R 26 ¦ ¦--ScrapeMetrature.R 27 ¦ ¦--ScrapePhotosNum.R 28 ¦ ¦--ScrapePostAuto.R 29 ¦ ¦--ScrapePropType.R 30 ¦ ¦--ScrapeReaReview.R 31 ¦ ¦--ScrapeStatus.R 32 ¦ ¦--ScrapeTotPiani.R 33 ¦ ¦--ScrapeType.R 34 ¦ °--take_location.R 35 ¦--scrapeALL.R 36 ¦--scrapeALLINFO.R 37 ¦--functions_url 38 ¦ ¦--ScrapeHREF.R 39 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrice.R 40 ¦ ¦--ScrapePrimaryKey.R 41 ¦ ¦--ScrapeRooms.R 42 ¦ ¦--ScrapeSpace.R 43 ¦ °--ScrapeTitle.R 44 ¦--libs.R 45 ¦--utils.R 46 ¦--README.Rmd 47 ¦--README.md 48 °--simulations 49 ¦--rt_match_vs_forloop.R 50 °--runtime_simul.R 2.6.1 Parallel Computing Since many html sessions are opened and within each session many requests are sent computations can take a while. For the sake of the analysis and the app this should not bother the end user because scraping tasks are performed daily and a single day is sufficient amount of runtime. In any case functions are optimized following the criteria stated before. Run time is crucial when dealing with time series and time to market in real estate is very important, this leads to have always fresh data. A way to secure fresh new data is to have lightweight computation on a single machine o heavy computation divided among a bunch of different machines, in this case sessions. All the following runtime examinations are performed on the scrape.all functions. A first attempt was using furrr package (Vaughan and Dancho 2018) which enables mapping through a list with the purrr , along with a future parallel backend. This has shows decent results, but its run time increases when more requests are sent. This leads to a preventive conclusion about the computational complexity: it has to be at least linear. Empirical demonstrations have been made: library(furrr) vecelaps = c() start = c() end = c() for (i in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start[i] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;, i, &quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) list.of.pages.imm[1:i] %&gt;% furrr::future_map(get.data.caturl, .progress = T) %&gt;% bind_rows() end[i] = Sys.time() vecelaps[i] = end[i] - start[i] } furrrmethod = tibble(start, end, vettoelaps) # ggplot (themed) run time meausurament method 1 p = ggplot(furrrmethod,aes(x=1:20, y=vettoelaps)) + geom_line( color=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Num URLS evaluated&quot;) + ylab(&quot;run time (in seconds)&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Run-Time for First method (furrr multisession)&quot;) + stat_smooth(method=lm) + theme_nicco() p computational complexity analysis with Furrr On the x-axis the number of urls evaluated together, iteration after iteration the urls considered are increased by one. On the y-axis the time measured in seconds. Looking at the smoothing curve in between an easy guess might be linear time \\(O(n)\\). A second attempt tried to explore the foreach package (Microsoft and Weston 2020). This interesting package enables a new looping construct for executing R code in an iterative way. With all the variety of existing (apply, lapply, sapply, eapply, mapply, rapply,) looping constructs, it might be doubted that there is a need for yet another construct. The main reason for using the foreach package is that it supports parallel execution, that is, it can execute those repeated operations on multiple processors/cores on the computer, or on multiple nodes of a cluster. The construction is straightforward: start clusters on processors cores define the iterator, in this case i = to the elements that are going to be iterated through .packages: Inherits the packages that are used in the tasks define below .combine: Define the combining function that bind results at the end (say cbind, rbind or tidyverse::bind_rows). It has to be a string. .errorhandling: specifies how a task evaluation error should be handle. %dopar%: the dopar keyword suggests foreach with parallelization method then the function within the elements are iterated close clusters One major important thing concerns the fact that th function within iterators repeats itself should be standalone. For standalone it is meant that the body function should be defined inside, as it would be a an empty environment. As a matter of fact packages has to be taken inside each time, and if the function is not defined inside body (or is not source from some other locations) the clusters can not operate and an error is printed. cl = makeCluster(detectCores()-1) registerDoParallel(cl) vettoelaps1 = c() start1 = c() end1 = c() for (j in 1:len(list.of.pages.imm[1:20])) { start1[j] = Sys.time() cat(&quot;\\n\\n run iteration&quot;,j,&quot;over 20 total\\n&quot;) foreach(i = seq_along(list.of.pages.imm[1:j]), .packages = lista.pacchetti, .combine = &quot;bind_rows&quot;, .errorhandling=&#39;pass&#39;) %dopar% { source(&quot;main.R&quot;) x = get.data.caturl(list.of.pages.imm[i]) } end1[j] = Sys.time() vettoelaps1[j] = end1[j] -start1[j] } stopCluster(cl) computational complexity analysis with Furrr It can be seen quite easily that the curve is flattened and resembles someway logarithmic time \\(O(log(n))\\). A further improvement could be obtained using a new package called doAzureParallel which is built on top of foreach. doAzureParallel enables different Virtual Machines operates parallel computing throughout Microsoft Azure cloud, but this comes at a substantial monetary cost. This would be a perfect match given that parallel methods seen before accelerates the number of requests sent among different processors or cluster, even though actually what it is really needed it is something that separates session. Unleashing Virtual Machines permits from one hand to further increase computational power and the number of potential requests, from the other it can splits requests among different user agents (a pool for each VM) masquerading even better the scraping automation. 2.7 Further Improvements expected The main challenge remains unsolved since each single elements has been finely optimized but API continues to be unstable. What it can not be optimized are the system ad choices to change the layout of the page or to change the url structure (allocation of datain the web page). The way the API is designed really facilitates fast debugging but this can not be automatized. The API continues to necessitate to have a continuous integration (i.e. CI) and back end review to verify the working status. Moreover Error messages can not really be undestood sometimes, this is due to functions that are called within a parallel beckend that does not allow [refererenza su stack overflow di errore di print] to print error on console. So each time an error occur the “main” functions needs to be taken out of from the foreach parallel backend and evaluated in isolation where the loop ends. This is trivial but for the time being no solutions have been found. 2.8 Legal Challenges (ancora non validato) “Data that are online and public are always available for all” is never a good answer to the question “Can I use that data to my scope”. Immobiliare.it is not providing any source of data from its own database neither it is planning to do so in the future. It has not even provided a paid API through which might be possible to perform analysis. However the golden standard for scraping was respected since the robot.txt file is clear allowing any actions as demonstrated above. What it worth noting is that some other popular player other like Idealista is using a different approach. Some of procedures that has been applied to the immboliare scraping was not possibile on the Idealista. This could be due to many reason: Idealista content is composed by Javascript so and html parser can no get that. Idealista blocks also certain web browser that have a demonstrated “career” in scraping procedures. All of this leads to accept that entry barriers to scrape are for sure higher than the one faced for Immobiliare. The reticence to share data could be a reflex on how big idealista is; as a matter of fact it has a heavy market presence in some of the Europe real estates country as Spain and France. So what they thought was to raise awareness on scraping procedure that in a certain way can hurt their business. This has been validated by the fact that prior filtering houses on their website a checkbox has to be signed. The checkbox make the user sign an agreement on their platform according to which data can not be misused and it belongs their intellectual property. References "]
