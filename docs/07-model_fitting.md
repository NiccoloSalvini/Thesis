## Model Selection

- wang pagina 49
In regression analysis, we often want to find a reduced model with the best subset of
the variables from the full model. The model selection in frequentist analysis is com-

the air pollution data example, a stepwise model selection procedure using AIC can
be implemented by the function stepAIC in R library MASS
