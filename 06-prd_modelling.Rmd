# Point Referenced Data Modeling {#prdm}


Geostatistical data are a collection of samples of geo type data indexed by coordinates (e.g. latlong, eastings and northings) that originate from a spatially continuous phenomenon [@Moraga2019]. What It can be observed is just a sample, some sites, from a continuous unobserved process which we aim to estimate. Data as such can monitor a vast range of natural or economic meausuraments, as example cancer detection [@Bell2006] at several sites, COVID19 spread in China [@Li_Li_Ding_Hu_Chen_Wang_Peng_Shen_2020] etc. For simplicity lets consider $y$ of interest observations $y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\right),y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\right), \ldots, y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\right)$
from a random spatial process $Y$,  $Y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\right),Y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{2}\right), \ldots, Y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\right)$ observed at location $\boldsymbol{s}_{1}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{s}_{n}$. In the context of geostatistical data each observation, once again, has to be considered as a partial realization of a random spatial process.
$\left\{Y(s): s \in D \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}\right\}$ , where D is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{r}$ a r-dimensional Euclidean space. 
When $r = 1$ it is a stochastic process widely encountered in literature e.g. time series process, nevertheless in this context there will be always $r = 2$ or eventually $r = 3$. The stochastic process $Y$ is observed in a fixed set of "monitoring stations" and inference can be done regarding moments of the realized process. This information are essential to build a spatially continuous surface over the y-studied variable in order to predict the phenomenon at locations not yet observed.

## Gaussian Random Fields (GRF)

A spatial process is said to be a **GF** if for any set of spatial index $n$ and for each set of corresponding locations $\left(y\left(s_{1}\right), \ldots, y\left(s_{n}\right)\right)$ follows a multivariate _Gaussian_ distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}=\left(\mu\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{1}\right), \ldots, \mu\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{n}\right)\right)$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$. The covariance matrix relates each observation to each others and it is expressed through a spatial covariance function defined as $\mathcal{C}(\cdot)$, such that $\Sigma_{i j}=\operatorname{Cov}\left(y\left(s_{i}\right), y\left(s_{j}\right)\right)=\mathcal{C}\left(y\left(s_{i}\right), y\left(s_{j}\right)\right)$. There are many covariance functions and their application with respect to the others depend on data and the scope on the analysis. Examples of spatial covariance functions are: Linear, Spherical, Matérn etc. The latter displays higher degree of flexibility and it the most used in geostatistics [@Krainski2018], therefore it will be implied in later analysis.
The spatial indexes $i$ and $j$ move around an $r = 2$ euclidean space and can be thought as coordinates on a $x,y$ euclidean axis. Moreover a spatial process can be either _first_ order stationary or _second_ order stationary. The former asserts that for any given spatial index $n$ and its correspondent $s_{1,\ldots,n}$ locations the distribution of the process $\left\{Y\left(s_{1}\right), \ldots, Y\left(s_{n}\right)\right\}$ is the same of the one in $\left\{Y\left(s_{1}+\boldsymbol{h}\right), \ldots, Y\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{n}+\boldsymbol{h}\right)\right\}$, where $h$ is a number belonging to $R^{2}$.

The second order stationarity states that the if the mean moment of the spatial process in constant over the study domain $\mu(\mathbf{s}) \equiv \mu$ (e.g. $E[L(s)]=\mu, \forall s \in D$) then the covariance functions does depend only on the distance between each couple points (euclidean $\left\|s_{i}-s_{j}\right\|$) separation. The natural consequence is that It does not matter whether the observations are placed either in a specific region, nor the direction towards they are oriented, all it counts it is their raw euclidean distance. In addition the process is said to be **Isotropic** if the covariance function depends only on the between-points distance. If the last assumption does not hold and direction towards point are distant from each other in the spatial domain D then the process is said to be **Anisotropic**.

Moreover since it is assumed to be true  $E[Y(\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{h})-Y(\mathbf{s})]=0$, the second moment of the latter expression can be written as $E[Y(\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{h})-Y(\mathbf{s})]^{2}$ that can be rewritten also as  $\operatorname{Var}(Y(\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{h})-Y(\mathbf{s}))$. Last expression is called _variogram_ and can be expressed though $2 \gamma(\mathbf{h})$, even tough its half is more often used and $\gamma(\mathbf{h})$ is named _semivariogram_ [ metti citation Cressie 2006]. 
The intuition behind this expression is that the difference in value between two near points $Y(\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{h})$ and $Y(\mathbf{h})$ is expected to be small with respect to the ones farther, in compliance with the first law of geography by Tobler: 

>"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"

![variogram example](images/variogram.png)


Semivariograms are an effient tool to asses spatial continuity but they are theretical. However semivargiogframs can be fitted to existing data giving birth to empirical semivariograms which are then plotted against the separation distance. The plot can be used to verify the null hypothesis of spatial independece and variability of the process. Below the functional form:

$\hat{\gamma}(t)=\frac{1}{2}|N(t)| \sum_{\left(\mathbf{s}_{i}, \mathbf{s}_{j}\right) \in N(t)}\left(Y\left(\mathbf{s}_{i}\right)-Y\left(\mathbf{s}_{j}\right)\right)^{2}$  


where $N(t)$ is the set of location pairs such that $\left\|\mathbf{s}_{i}-\mathbf{s}_{j}\right\|=t$ and so $|N(t)|$ is the number of pairs in the set. As already guessed before empirical semivariogram values are expected to be small at short pairs distance and tends to increase when distance increases. The rational behind is that similar observations are expected to lay close together (small $h$) leading to lower semivariogram values($\gamma(\mathbf{h})$), as opposite farther pairs obervations (big $h$) tend to be different and associated to greater semivariogram values. Flat semivariogram might indicate small spatial variance, since whether distance $h$ increases or not, semivariogram values remains the same $\frac{\Delta\gamma(\mathbf{h})}{\Delta\mathbf{h}}\approx0$. Semivariograms are also implied later in the modelling process to evaluate if any spatial pattern in still present in the residuals. The three main arguments in semivariograms are: _range_ $\sigma^{2}$, _nugget_ $\tau^{2}$ and _sill_ $\tau^{2}+\sigma^{2}$. [parameters explanation]

## The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach (SPDE)

SPDE [Lindegren] allows to extend the GF continuous process observations starting from the GMRF. Equation to start is a fractional partial differential: 

$\left(\kappa^{2}-\Delta\right)^{\alpha / 2}(\tau \xi(s))=\mathcal{W}(s)$

where $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{r}$, $\Delta$ is the Laplacian function, $\alpha$ tunes the smoothness, $\kappa>0$ is the scale parameter, $\tau$ controls the variance, and $\mathcal{W}(s)$ is a Gaussian spatila white noise process. The solution blended with conveninet Matèrn covariance function is: 

$\operatorname{Cov}\left(\xi\left(s_{i}\right), \xi\left(s_{j}\right)\right)=\operatorname{Cov}\left(\xi_{i}, \xi_{j}\right)=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\Gamma(\lambda) 2^{\lambda-1}}\left(\kappa\left\|s_{i}-s_{j}\right\|\right)^{\lambda} K_{\lambda}\left(\kappa\left\|s_{i}-s_{j}\right\|\right)$

## Hedonic class models for Rental House Market

The theoretical foundation of the HPM i.e. hedonic price models relies on the consumer utility theory of Lancaster’s (1966) and in Rosen's model [Rosen, 1974]. The general principle in HPM suggests that the value of a commodity can be calculated by the estimated values of its separate properties. Applying HPM to real estate, house pricing (also renting) is given by the unit cost of each household characteristic, therefore the expenditures associated with them. More generally the discussion might be also opened to how much adding a household expenditure impacts the total price of the house [letteratura]. In addition It can be also extended to how much a new infrastructure (transports, new public places) will drive house price value [letteratura]. Both of the twp points mentioned are interesting research prospects but are beyond the scope of the analysis. 
According to HPM Hedonic Price function establishes a general functional relationship between the observed household expenditures on housing, $P(H)$, and the level of characteristics contained in vector $H$. $P(H)=f\left(h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3}, \ldots, h_{n}\right)$. 
A first attempt to include spatial effect in urban economic literature is provided by Alonso (1964). Its contribution was to raise voice on house prices (also rent) mainly depending on land price and a number of purely spatial covariates like CBD, the distance from City Business District. Other covariates were transport cost per kilometer and community income, even though they were defined also as spatial parameters through distances. The model proposed by Alonso is called monocentric since the centroid from which distances are calculated is only one. Moreover a first touch to spatial data thory was done since the CBD was defined as areal unit with well-defined boundaries of regular or irregular shape. However Applications of the model were not convincing since obervations offered a different picture. Results instead displayed a Poly-centric areal structure (universities and Malls) which might have driven prices. The model also assumed that covariates like CBD are only informative within city center boundaries and then displayed no significance out of the core of the city. Poly-centric theory was also more coherent with the architectural and socio-economical evolution of cities during recent times, therefore mono centric theory was then criticized and abandoned. Critics regarded also neighborhood quality measure and boundary problems Dubin (1987). Dubin for these reasons developed a geostatistical model including areal effects in the error term since handling these covariates was posing several hard challenges. Here relies part of the reason why the problem in this analysis is approached as point reference and not as areal.
During literature evolution on HPM, as it is already been explained, discussions on vector $H$ have risen. Though generally they can be grouped into two macro domains:

- Residential structure characteristics, such as: house size, and the number of rooms, number of bathrooms (inner data effect)
- Effects associated with the geographic location (locational effects), both between houses and within other existing infrastructures, events or areas. (outer data effect)

For the scope of the analysis residential structure covariates and locational between houses effects are considered. Exogenous effects such as crime rate and transports are not included in the model since prices and rents are already incorporating that information. 
As a final remark scholars would argue that rent values do not represent the actual value of real estate. Nevertheless in empirical analysis rent value are considered a proxy for the price of real estate [@Herath_Maier_2011]. A further argument to endorse this hypothesis is brought by [@sellingVSrental] considering housing a commodity, then the selling or the rental should be considered interchangeable economic actions with respect to same inner need to satisfy. This is also stronger in this case since the latter statement is referred to a paper exclusively based on italian real estate analysis. Moreover Capozza and Seguin [@Capozza_Seguin_1996] discussed about how much rent-price ratio predicts future changes both in rents and prices. Among other issues raised they pinpointed the decomposition of rent-price ratio into two parts: the predictable part and the unexplained residuals part. The predictable part was in negative relationship with price changes, in other words cities in which prices are relatively high with respect to rents are associated with higher capital gains that justifies that misalignment. This is also true for the opposite, that is cities in which prices are higher with respect to the rents, and this can not be associated to any local condition, realizes lower capital gains. One other demonstration of price-rent exchangeablity and strong correlation is offered by Clark [@Clark_1995] which traces the Capozza and Seguin work. Rent-price ratio is negatively correlated with following future changes in rents. In other words prices are still higher when areas in which they are observed documents an increase in rent prices. All the literature review above is oriented to a long-run alignement of price and rent. 


## Points Referenced Bayesian data analysis

Since the relationships between the characteristics of the house, i.e. vector $H$, and the price is not explicited in economic literature it is possible to assume whichever $f$ functional form. [linear non linear functional  etc aggiungi qualcosa]. The open possibility to apply any relationship between covariates comes very handy in the INLA setting \ref(latentGaussian) since latent gaussian models are designed to be prepared to accept any $f$ relation.
If it assumed a linear relationship among covariates then a classical bayesian non-spatial linear regression can relate a y response variable with its covariates and error through the expression:

$$y_{i}=\mu_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}$$

where $y_{i}$ is normally distributed as $y_{i} \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(\mu_{i}, \sigma^{2}\right)$  and $\mu_{i}$ is the mean structure that might linearly depend on some $\mathbf{X}$ covariates, $\beta$ coefficients and $\varepsilon$ white noise error. Keeping in mind the INLA notation, the linear predictor can be written as $\eta_{i}=\beta_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_{j} x_{i m}$, where the $i$ pedix is the observation number and the $j$ pedix is the mth covariate.  Moreover it is possible to specify $\eta$ as a function of $\mu$. The link function between them in this case is identity, so that $\eta_{i}=g\left(\mu_{i}\right)=\mu_{i}$. In other modeling cases where response has to stay between $[0,1]$ (e.g. probabilities) the link function has to Logit, giving birth to logistic regression. More generally expressed in vector notation:

$y\left(\mathbf{s}_{i}\right)=\mathbf{x}\left(\mathbf{s}_{i}\right)^{\prime} \boldsymbol{\beta_{j}}+\varepsilon\left(\mathbf{s}_{i}\right)$

where its OLS estimator is $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\left(\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{y}${#ols}

However in many cases non-linear functions, like basis function might be a smoother solution to model coordinates when used as covariates [@Krainski2018].

Moreover In the context of bayesian analysis a prior distribution has to be imposed on the regression coefficients $\beta = \left\{\beta_{0}, \ldots, \beta_{J}\right\}$ as well ad on the variance  $\sigma^{2}$ of $y_{i}$. When no expert information is provided vague priors are introduced, meaning that the regression should not be weighted too much on the priors choice. 
Vague priors might be:

- $\beta_{m} \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(0,10^{6}\right)$ for the beta coefficients
- $\log (\tau)=\log \left(1 / \sigma^{2}\right) \sim \log \operatorname{Gamma}\left(1,10^{-5}\right)$ for precision 


_A comparison between standard regression and bayesian regression might help to integrate bayesian methods into HPM. If the response var y is a vector representing the outcome, if $\mathbf{X}$ is its matrix covariates and if the intercept_ $\beta_{0}$ _is a 1 elements vector, then the OLS estimator, once again in \@ref(ols) where its standard error in vector notations is:_ $\operatorname{se}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})=\sqrt{s^{2}\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1}}$ 
_On each regression coefficient can be obtained a  $(100 −\alpha)$% confidence interval whose interpratation is a unkown quantity that is fixed_


When leveraging information from location an added has to be introduced in the previous equation in order to fully incorporate spatial properties,

$y(\mathbf{s})=\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{s})^{\prime} \beta+w(\mathbf{s})+\varepsilon(\mathbf{s})$

where the $w(\mathbf{s})$ is the entire surface $D$ that encloses observations. The $w(\mathbf{s})$ in the context of the analysis is approached as a GF, seen in the previous section, whose distribution is multivariate with mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}(\mathbf{s})$ in function of the spatial index $\mathbf{s}$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$.
$\varepsilon(\mathbf{s})$ is iid and mean centered in 0 with variance $\tau^{2}$ and is called the non-spatial error since it contributes to the nugget. The error term is nit pure since it interfers with the covariance function so the model can be fully spatial
