# Abstract

This thesis project originally comes from a problem arised during the first time spent in Milan while looking for a house. I was pretty disappointed when many of the housing solutions that I found on popular online website were either too costly or unavaible. It was pretty clear since the moment I started searching that It would have been a mess for many reasons. The most frustrating one was the absurdly high monthly rent cost of some places with respect to its characteristics.
