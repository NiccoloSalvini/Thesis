### Introduction:

This repo contains my master thesis project which is a collection of
various works done for single exams. What I did was fronting different
angles of the same problem. I started by collecting all the data from
various sources by **Scraping**, and then passing through **Shiny** web
app development and in the end getting deep with methodologies and
modelling into **Spatial Analysis**. This project virtually sums up the
effort I have been putting into the real estate market starting from
september 2018.
