According to Google research devoted to the analysis of USA real estate
buyers’ habits (National Association of Realtors, Google 2012), out of 10 %
homebuyers use the Internet as one of the primary research tools, and 52 % of
customers start their search using the Internet. According to the information
presented by Google, the number of real estate searches grows up yearly by 22 %. 
The main reason for customers is to find information which can reduce purchasing
related risks (Peterson & Merino, 2003).
In Latvia, 79.7 % of the population now goes online regularly (Latvijas
Interneta Asociācija, 2015). Latvian Internet users have the same habits as the
Internet users of the USA or developed Western countries. 7 out of 10 Internet
users (70 %) look for information on web pages (CSP, 2015). Real estate buyers
read general information about a real estate object and compare prices of various
real estate objects



<!-- estratto dall'introduzione dellpinfrastrutture, ha senso messo qua  -->
As a general discussion technologies implied can be thought as the distance between a service running locally on a laptop and something that it can actually be put into production, shared among company stakeholders, solving business related problems. When such technologies are applied data scientist and interlocutors gradually close the gap. Insights are better communicated, data is up-to-date and automation can save time. Nonetheless when the infrastructure is structured with vision then integrating or substituting existing technologies is not trivial. Anyway technologies can not be always embedded because they might be exclusively designed to work only on certain back ends, therefore some choices are not into discussion. With foresight RStudio by setting future-oriented guidelines has spent a lot of effort giving its users an easy, integrated and interconnected environment. By that it is meant that the RStudio community has tried to either integrate or open the possibility to a number of technologies that fill the blanks in their weaker parts. On top of many, an entire package has been dedicated to democratize REST APIs (Plumber [@plumber]). As a further example developers in RStudio have created an entire new paradigm i.e. Shiny [@shiny], a popular web app development package, that enforces the developer to have front-end and back-end technologies tied up in the same IDE. They also added performance monitoring and optimization packages that are fitted into shiny such as shinytest [metti tag] and shinyloadtest [metti tag] to simulate sessions and verify network traffic congestion.
